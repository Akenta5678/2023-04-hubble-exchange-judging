# getUnderlyingPrice() doesn't check If Arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
Not checking if the sequencer is down may result in bd actors obtaining inconsistent and unfair prices.

## Vulnerability Detail
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
Example:https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code
There is no check in the Oracle.sol
```solidity
 function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
        virtual
        external
        view
        returns(int256 answer)
    {
        if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
            return stablePrice[underlying];
        }
        (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
        require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
        answer /= 100;
    }
```
## Impact
Could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
