# `SCALING_FACTOR` is wrong where `1e12` != `1e18` hence less `ETH` is sent.

## Summary
In `HGT.sol` when sending the amount is supposed to be scaled by a factor of `18` decimals, but the `SCALING_FACTOR` is set to `1e12`, sending far less `ETH` to the address
## Vulnerability Detail
`HGT.sol` the `_creditTo` function
```solidity
    uint256 public constant SCALING_FACTOR = 1e12;
```
Here you can see the SCALING_FACTOR = 1e12, and 
```solidity
          // scale amount to 18 decimals
        _amount *= SCALING_FACTOR;

        // transfer amount to user
        payable(_toAddress).transfer(_amount);
 circulatingSupply += _amount;
```
Here the amount is scaled by a lower factor causing less `ETH` to be sent to the address, and there will be an internal accounting issue where the `circulatingSupply += _amount`.
## Impact
The `_creditTo` function sends far less `ETH` than suppose to, and there will be an internal accounting issue that could break the protocol.

## Recommendation
correct the `SCALING_FACTOR` 
```solidity
    uint256 public constant SCALING_FACTOR = 1e18;
```
