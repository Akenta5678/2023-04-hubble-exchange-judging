# trade/liquidatin fee is calculated twice in ClearingHouse.liquidate()

## Summary
This is because _chargeFeeAndRealizePnL() is called twice in ClearingHouse.liquidate() function with   `IOrderBook.OrderExecutionMode.Liquidation` as the mode

## Vulnerability Detail
Take a look at the snippet below:
```solidity
function liquidate(
        IOrderBook.Order calldata order,
        IOrderBook.MatchInfo calldata matchInfo,
        int256 liquidationAmount,
        uint price,
        address trader
    )
        override
        external
        onlyOrderBook
        returns (uint256 openInterest)
    {
        try this.liquidateSingleAmm(trader, order.ammIndex, price, liquidationAmount) {//@audit inside  here
            // only executed if the above doesn't revert
            try this.openPosition(order, liquidationAmount, price, matchInfo.mode, true) returns(uint256 _openInterest) {//@audit  inside here
                openInterest = _openInterest;
            } catch Error(string memory reason) {
                // will revert all state changes including those made in this.liquidateSingleAmm
                revert(string(abi.encode(matchInfo.orderHash, reason)));
            }
        } catch Error(string memory reason) {
            // surface up the error to the calling contract
            revert(string(abi.encode(LIQUIDATION_FAILED, reason)));
        }
    }
```
_chargeFeeAndRealizePnL() is called within _liquidateSingleAmm() function in liquidateSingleAmm() [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L198) 
```solidity
  try this.liquidateSingleAmm(trader, order.ammIndex, price, liquidationAmount)
```

AND 

_chargeFeeAndRealizePnL() is also called within _openPosition() function in openPosition() [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L200) 
```solidity
 try this.openPosition(order, liquidationAmount, price, matchInfo.mode, true) returns(uint256 _openInterest)
```

## Impact

## Recommendation
rework ClearingHouse.liquidate() so as to ensure trade/liquidatin fee isn't calculated twice
