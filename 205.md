# Buyer can buy all available collateral from an ongoing auction for almost 99% discount leading to massive loss of funds

High
## Summary
A buyer can buy collateral from an ongoing auction at the *current auction price* using `buyCollateralFromAuction` in the contract `InsuranceFund.sol`. But it turns out that as the time of the auction increases, the `startPrice` keeps on decreasing until a time comes when the price is almost negligible when the auction is about to end. The user can wait until the expiry time of the auction & call the function `buyCollateralFromAuction` & pay almost negligible amount to acquire all the tokens in the auction.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `buyCollateralFromAuction` function calls ` _calcVusdAmountForAuction` to calculate the vusd amount to transfer.
```solidity
function buyCollateralFromAuction(address token, uint amount) override external {
        Auction memory auction = auctions[token];
        // validate auction
        require(_isAuctionOngoing(auction.startedAt, auction.expiryTime), "IF.no_ongoing_auction");

        // transfer funds
        uint vusdToTransfer = _calcVusdAmountForAuction(auction, token, amount);   ------> @audit
        address buyer = _msgSender();
        vusd.safeTransferFrom(buyer, address(this), vusdToTransfer);
        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(buyer, amount); // will revert if there wasn't enough amount as requested
        ................
        }
    }
```
`_calcVusdAmountForAuction` calls `_getAuctionPrice` to get the current price at the auction.

```solidity
function _calcVusdAmountForAuction(Auction memory auction, address token, uint amount) internal view returns(uint) {
        uint price = _getAuctionPrice(auction);
        uint _decimals = ERC20Detailed(token).decimals();  // will fail if .decimals() is not defined on the contract
        return amount * price / 10 ** _decimals;
    }
```
The issue lies here. 

```solidity
function _getAuctionPrice(Auction memory auction) internal view returns (uint) {
        uint diff = auction.startPrice * (_blockTimestamp() - auction.startedAt) / auctionDuration;
        return auction.startPrice - diff;
```

The `auctionDuration` is fixed at 2 hours. (7200 sec)
Lets take the following scenario into consideration:

- Lets assume that the startPrice is 100.
- Suppose the buyer waits until the last minute to buy collateral, say at 1 hour 59 minute (7140 sec).
- Taking the  above value & calculating `diff`,
-  uint diff = auction.startPrice * (_blockTimestamp() - auction.startedAt) / auctionDuration;
           diff = 100 * (7140) / 7200
           diff = 99

- & the return amount is = auction.startPrice - diff
                                        = 100 - 99
                                        = 1

- If the amount of tokens available were `100`, the buyer pays now has to pay $100 for the tokens which were worth $10,000.
- At an almost 99% discount.

## Impact

Using this vulnerability, the buyer can never be liquidated as it has excess collateral to save itself from any loss that occurs &  this vulnerability leads to loss of funds to the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the auction price such that it can't go below a certain point or percentage.
