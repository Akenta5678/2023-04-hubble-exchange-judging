# `getUnderlyingPrice` doesn't check If Arbitrum sequencer is down or for grace periods. in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check:
`getUnderlyingPrice`
```solidity
        if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
            return stablePrice[underlying];
        }
        (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
        require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
        answer /= 100;
```
## Impact
could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
