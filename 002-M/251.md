# `Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice` not checking Oracle answer for staleness

## Summary

If the Oracle feed suffers from staleness, an attacker can potentially liquidate a trader position which is totally healthy, thus acquiring collateral with a substantial discount at the expense of the trader.

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside `Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice` the price data is fetched via a call to `latestRoundData()`:

But only the `answer` is checked.

The `answer` is then used here for liquidation:

## Impact

A trader can potentially get liquidated by a malicious actor that observes the Oracle feed and acts on staleness, abusing the issue in `Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice` described above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding staleness checks to `Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice()`:

```solidity
// Oracle
// getUnderlyingPrice
33        (uint80 roundID, answer, ,uint256 timestamp ,uint80 answeredInRound) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
34        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
35        require(timestamp != 0, "Round not complete");
```
