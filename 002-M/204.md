# Stale Price in Underlying Asset Price Calculation

## Summary
The getUnderlyingPrice function in the Oracle contract does not check for stale prices. This means that the function could return a price that is outdated and no longer accurate.
## Vulnerability Detail
 This vulnerability could allow a malicious user to purchase the underlying asset at a lower price than they should.
## Impact
getUnderlyingPrice function does not check for stale prices. This could allow a malicious user to purchase the underlying asset at a lower price than they should.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 The getUnderlyingPrice function should be updated to check for stale prices. This can be done by adding:
 ```solidity
require(timestamp != 0,"Stale Price");
```
```solidity
    function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
        virtual
        external
        view
        returns(int256 answer)
    {
        if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
            return stablePrice[underlying];
        }
        (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
        + require(timestamp != 0,"Stale Price");
        answer /= 100; 
```
