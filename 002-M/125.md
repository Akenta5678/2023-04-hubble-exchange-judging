# Chainlink price data may be outdated and stale

## Summary

The report indicates that there is a vulnerability in the chainlink oracle that is used to determine the worth of an asset. The vulnerability lies in the code's failure to check the updated timestamp of the chainlink, which allows for the use of stale or outdated chainlink data. As a result, token prices may be unfairly evaluated on the blockchain.

## Vulnerability Detail

The code snippet provided shows the `getUnderlyingPrice` function, which retrieves the price of an underlying asset using the chainlink oracle. However, the code does not include a check for the updated timestamp of the chainlink data. This omission allows for the usage of stale or outdated chainlink information.

```solidity
 function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
        virtual
        external
        view
        returns(int256 answer)
    {
        if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
            return stablePrice[underlying];
        }
        (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
        require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
        answer /= 100;
    }
```

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that token prices will be evaluated on-chain based on outdated or stale information. This can lead to inaccurate asset valuations and potentially unfair trading conditions.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerable code can be found [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/1f9a5ed0ca8f6004bbb7b099ecbb8ae796557849/hubble-protocol/contracts/Oracle.sol#L33).

## Tool Used

The vulnerability was identified through a manual review.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to modify the code to include a check for the updated timestamp of the chainlink data. This check will ensure that only the most recent and accurate price information is used in evaluating token prices.
