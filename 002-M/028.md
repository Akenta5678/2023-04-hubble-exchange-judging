# Medim severity - No check for stale price feeds

## Summary

getLatestRoundData function in Oracle.sol does not check for price feed staleness which can lead to wrong price return value.

## Vulnerability Detail
Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated. There is no check for stale price. Price can be stale and lead to wrong return value.

## Impact
Stale data can lead to wrong price.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
(, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt, ) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        if(updatedAt < block.timestamp - 60 * 60 /* 1 hour */) {
            revert("stale price feed");
        } 
        require(price > 0, "invalid price");
```

The potential solution is to validate that no more than 1 hour has passed from the "updatedAt" timestamp value returned from "latestRoundData()", otherwise the transaction will revert
