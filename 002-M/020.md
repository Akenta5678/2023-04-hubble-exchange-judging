# Oracle.sol#getUnderlyingPrice/getLatestRoundData - no additional checks for stale return data

## Summary
The Oracle.sol serves the purpose of providing accurate prices for the provided underlying assets, using the AggregatorV3's latestRoundData function if no stable price is defined for the given asset. Due to lack of checks on the additional return data other than the price, stale data can be passed back to the other contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Oracle.sol's ``getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)`` we check for the existence of a stable price for said asset and if it is 0, a.k.a not initialized then we get the data from the oracle. A check is done to confirm the returned price (``answer`` in the contract) is positive, but never check the other returned variables to confirm that the data is not stale. 
## Impact
This could lead to stale prices thus disrupting calculations and leading to unexpected damage to funds inside the protocol.
