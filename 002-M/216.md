# Insufficient checks on chainlink prices

## Summary

Oracle doesnt check for the age of the price. Can be outdated.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract `Oracle.sol` carries out some functions related to the oracle. The contract shows hints of using the Chainlink oracle due to the presence of `AggregatorV3Interface` interfaces. According to the chainlink docs, contracts must verify the age of the last reported price to prevent the use of outdated prices. However, the contract does not do so, as can be seen in the following snippet where it is used below.

Here, the contract only makes sure that the answer is non-zero. It does not check the timestamp of when the data was provided, and thus is susceptible to using stale price values.

## Impact

Contract can use stale prices.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the timestamp of the returned `latestRoundData`. Compare it against a threshold and only allow operations if the price is recent enough.
