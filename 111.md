# MinimalForwarder doesn’t check if the to address is a contract

## Summary

The `executeRequiringSuccess()` doesn’t enforce that the `to` address is a smart contract so all calls to an EoA will always return success.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `executeRequiringSuccess()` function calls `execute()` internally but this function does not check if the `to` address is a smart contract. As such, any calls to an EoA will always return success.

Do also note that OpenZeppelin documentation stated that "MinimalForwarder is mainly meant for testing, as it is missing features to be a good production-ready forwarder.” 

## Impact

The impact depends on the protocols / applications that integrate with the MinimalForwarder / relies on `executeRequiringSuccess`. For example, if it tries to send some msg.value to a contract expecting something in return, this will fail silently if the `to` address is an EoA.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of just inheriting from openzeppelin’s minimal forwarder, write your own forwarder that checks that the to address is a smart contract.
