# Inurance Fund susceptible to inflation attacks

## Summary

Insurance fund susceptible to inflation attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The insurance fund is stored in the contract `InsuranceFund.sol`. This contract is susceptible to an inflation attack similar to the well-known inflation attacks on ERC4626 vaults.

The attack can be carried out when the contract is nearly empty in the following steps.

1. Attacker calls `deposit()` with 1 wei amount. This will mint 1 token for the attacker.
2. Attacker "donates" to the pool 1e6 VUSD via external transfer.
3. Victim comes and deposits 2e6 VUSD. Shares are calculated with `amount * _totalSupply / _pool`. Here `amount` is 2e6, `_totalSupply` is 1, and `_pool` is 1e6+1. So the victim gets 1 share minted to them instead of 2 due to a rounding error.
4. Attacker withdraws. Since they have 1 share and the `_totalSupply` is 2 shares, they get 50% of the total pot, which is 1.5e6 VUSD, netting them a profit of 0.5e6 VUSD.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Lock the initial 1e6 tokens which will be minted. This will be enough to prevent such large rounding errors.
