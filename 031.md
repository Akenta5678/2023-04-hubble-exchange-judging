# `getRoundData` does not check for the freshness of the answer

## Summary
`getRoundData` does not check for price freshness

**Warning:** While the `latestRoundData` function no longer needs to check for round completeness, the `getRoundData` function needs to check for `answeredInRound` and `roundId` for price freshness and `latestTimestamp` for round completeness. As proof you can see the links I have provided.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `ChainlinkAggregator.sol` the contract calls the `getRoundData()` function in several places.
As we can see from [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data#getrounddata-return-values) the function returns the following values:
- `roundId`: The round ID
- `answer`: The answer for this round
- `startedAt`: Timestamp of when the round started
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp of when the round was updated
- `answeredInRound`: The round ID in which the answer was computed

`answeredInRound` is the combination of `aggregatorAnsweredInRound` and `phaseId`. `aggregatorAnsweredInRound`: The round the answer was updated in. You can check `answeredInRound` against the current `roundId`. If `answeredInRound` is less than `roundId`, the answer is carried over. 
If `answeredInRound` is equal to `roundId`, then the answer is fresh.

Also, you need to validate that the timestamp on that round is not 0.

## Impact

The price may not be fresh and the round not complete.

## Recommendation

Check for price freshness:

```solidity
require(answeredInRound == roundId, "the price is not fresh")

require(latestTimestamp > 0, "Round not complete");
```
