# The slot locations of the AMM, ClearingHouse, MarginAccount are incorrect

## Summary

These three contracts inherit from other contracts and have additional slots that are incorrectly located in the comments, which can cause bibliophile to read data incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
contract ClearingHouse is IClearingHouse, HubbleBase {
    int256 override public maintenanceMargin; // SLOT_1 !!! used in precompile !!!

contract HubbleBase is Governable, Pausable {

contract VanillaGovernable {
    address private _governance;
contract Governable is VanillaGovernable, Initializable {}
```

As you can see from the code, the first slot is not `maintenanceMargin`, but `_governance`. This can cause the bibliophile to read the wrong data.

```go
const (
	CLEARING_HOUSE_GENESIS_ADDRESS       = "0x0300000000000000000000000000000000000002"
	AMMS_SLOT                      int64 = 12
	MAINTENANCE_MARGIN_SLOT        int64 = 1
	MIN_ALLOWABLE_MARGIN_SLOT      int64 = 2
)
```

## Impact

The slot locations of the AMM, ClearingHouse, MarginAccount are incorrect. Bibliophile will read wrong data.
