# More checks needed for Chainlink price feed return values

## Summary
Get `getUnderlyingPrice` in `Oracle.sol` does not check for the return values returned by the Chainlink price feed's `latestRoundData` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
As the summary above states, not checking these values could result in stale/incorrect prices. For example, suppose there is a problem with Chainlink starting a new [round](https://solodit.xyz/issues/5699) and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle. In that case, consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data. Another issue that can arise due to insufficient checks on the price of the asset - https://solodit.xyz/issues/6663

## Impact
Stale/Incorrect data will be used for the token prices.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use the following checks:

```solidity
require(price > 0, "Negative Oracle Price");
require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= outdated , "ChainLinkOracle: outdated.");
require(price < maxPrice, "Upper price bound breached");
require(price > minPrice, "Lower price bound breached");
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "round not complete");
```
