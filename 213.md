# Orders with status as cancelled or filled cannot be placed again.

## Summary
 orders cancelled  or filled have their order status  set as cancelled and filled respectively . When deleting order info , order status is not supposed to be deleted since the same order can be placed again. However, a requirement for placing orders is that the order status should be invalid . This will prevent orders with status cancelled or filled from being placed once again.

## Vulnerability Detail

 * @notice Deletes everything except status and filledAmount from orderInfo
    * @dev cannot delete order status because then same order can be placed again
    */
    function _deleteOrderInfo(bytes32 orderHash) internal {
        delete orderInfo[orderHash].blockPlaced;
        delete orderInfo[orderHash].reservedMargin;
    }

        require(orderInfo[orderHash].status == OrderStatus.Invalid, "OB_Order_already_exists");
This require statement in function place order will prevent orders with statuses apart from invalid being placed once again.

## Impact
Traders with orders whose statuses are cancelled or filled cannot place orders as a result they cannot participate in trades anymore.
