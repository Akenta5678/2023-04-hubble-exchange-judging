# Restarting an Auction of a specific token is not possible in the `InsuranceFund` contract unless there is another trader with bad debt and that specific token

## Summary

The [InsuranceFund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol) contract does not have a method to `restart an Auction` manually causing the tokens that were not bought in an auction to get trapped in the `InsuranceFund` contract until there is another trader with bad debt and the auction could be [started again](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L409).

## Vulnerability Detail

The Auction for a specific token is started when a trader is in bad debt via the [settleBadDebt()#409](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L409) function.

```solidity
File: MarginAccount.sol
382:     function settleBadDebt(address trader) external whenNotPaused {
...
...
403:         for (uint i = 1 /* skip vusd */; i < assets.length; i++) {
404:             int amount = margin[i][trader];
405:             if (amount > 0) {
406:                 margin[i][trader] = 0;
407:                 assets[i].token.safeTransfer(address(insuranceFund), amount.toUint256());
408:                 seized[i] = amount.toUint256();
409:                 insuranceFund.startAuction(address(assets[i].token));
410:             }
411:         }
412:         emit SettledBadDebt(trader, seized, badDebt, _blockTimestamp());
413:     }
```

When the Auction is started, it specifies an expiration of 2 hours.

```solidity
File: InsuranceFund.sol
167:     function startAuction(address token) override external onlyMarginAccount {
...
...
171:             auctions[token] = Auction(
172:                 currentPrice * startPriceMultiplier / PRECISION,
173:                 currentTimestamp,
174:                 currentTimestamp + auctionDuration
175:             );
176:         }
177:     }
```

So the collateral buyers can buy the collateral token while the auction is ongoing. The validation is in the [187 code line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L187).

```solidity
File: InsuranceFund.sol
184:     function buyCollateralFromAuction(address token, uint amount) override external {
185:         Auction memory auction = auctions[token];
186:         // validate auction
187:         require(_isAuctionOngoing(auction.startedAt, auction.expiryTime), "IF.no_ongoing_auction");
...
...
```

The problem is that the auction can end without having sold all the collateral tokens, so the tokens will be trapped in the `InsuranceFund` contract until there is another trader with bad debt and with the same token that was trapped in the contract.

Please see the next scenario:

1. There is a trader with bad debt and it [starts the auction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L409) for token `XYZ`.
2. Nobody is interested and the auction ends without having sold all the `XYZ` tokens.
3. The tokens will be trapped in the `InsuranceFund` contract until another trader with bad debt and `XYZ` token can [start the auction again](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L409).
4. The time passes and there is no trader with bad debt and `XYZ` token. The `XYZ` token price may drop and the `InsuranceFund` can not sell/auction manually causing to receive less for the `XYZ` token.

## Impact

The unsold collateral tokens will be trapped in the `InsuranceFund` contract until another trader with bad debt and that token can restart the auction. This could be a problem if the unsold token price drop and the `InsuranceFund` can not sell/auction manually those tokens.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Add a method in the [InsuranceFund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol) contract which allows to restart an auction of unsold tokens.
