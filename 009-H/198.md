# Denial of service in VUSD.processWithdrawals function

## Summary
The use of a low-level call that allows the recipient to consume almost all available gas, causing the whole transaction to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the `processWithdrawals()` function, a low-level call is made to the withdrawal.usr contract [VUSD.sol#L75](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/VUSD.sol#L75). This call allows the recipient contract to utilize 63 out of 64 of gas allocated to the transaction, leaving very little remaining for subsequent operations. Additionally, the recipient contract can return a large amount of data, further consuming any remaining gas and preventing the execution of subsequent opcodes.

## Impact
Legitimate withdrawals are unable to be processed due to the depletion of gas

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
            (bool success, bytes memory data) = withdrawal.usr.call{value: withdrawal.amount}("");
            if (success) {
                reserve -= withdrawal.amount;
            } else {
                emit WithdrawalFailed(withdrawal.usr, withdrawal.amount, data);
            }
            i += 1;
        }
        // re-entracy not possible, hence can update `start` at the end
        start = i;
    }
   ```
