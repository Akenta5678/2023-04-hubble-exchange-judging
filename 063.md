# Oracle data is insufficiently validated

## Summary

Many important contracts like AMM, InsuranceFund uses `getUnderlyingPrice` method to get the latest Price of the token. But the price is not validated sufficiently.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `Oracle.sol` contract, `getUnderlyingPrice` method uses latestRoundData() function to get price from chainlink.

However, neither round completeness or the quoted timestamp are checked to ensure that the reported price is not stale. 

```solidity
function latestRoundData() external view
    returns (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer, 
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    )
```

That's the reason Chainlink recommends using their data feeds along with some controls to prevent mismatches with the retrieved data.

## Impact

The retrieved price of the priceFeed can be outdated and used anyways as a valid data because no timestamp tolerance of the update source time is checked while storing the return parameters of priceFeed.latestRoundData(). The usage of outdated data can impact on how the further logics of that price are implemented.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: Oracle.sol

    (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

As Chainlink recommends:

>Your application should track the latestTimestamp variable or use the updatedAt value from the latestRoundData() function to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough for your application to use it. If your application detects that the reported answer is not updated within the heartbeat or within time limits that you determine are acceptable for your application, pause operation or switch to an alternate operation mode while identifying the cause of the delay.

Add a check for timestamp such that last price update has happened within the acceptable `heartbeat` period.

Mitigated Code:

```diff
File: Oracle.sol

-     (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
+     (uint80 roundID, answer,,uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
      require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
+     require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < HEARTBEAT_PERIOD, "Chainlink: Stale Price");
+     require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Chainlink: Stale Price");


```
