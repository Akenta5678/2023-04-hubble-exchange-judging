# Decimal Truncation in Auction Price Calculation

## Summary
 The startAuction function has a vulnerability in the math.
## Vulnerability Detail
The currentPrice variable is a 6-decimal number, the startPriceMultiplier variable is a 7-decimal number, and the PRECISION constant is a 16-decimal number
## Impact
when it goes through that line :
```solidity
currentPrice * startPriceMultiplier / PRECISION,
```
it will always return 0
This vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious user to create an auction with a very low price

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The startAuction function should be updated to use a different method to calculate the price of the auction
