# Reducing position size can also put the trader below the required margin due to fees paid

## Summary
`assertMarginRequirement` of a trader is only checked after opening position if position size is increased, i.e. `varGroup.isPositionIncreased`. However, we should also be checking even when position size is reduced due to the fees that is paid.

## Vulnerability Detail
Fee is charged whenever a position is opened. For example, if the mode is maker, then the trader has to pay the maker fee. This means that it is possible for a trader to call `openPosition` with the intention of reducing the size of his position, his position can enter the insufficient margin state at the end of the call. 

```solidity
  function _openPosition(IOrderBook.Order memory order, int256 fillAmount, uint256 fulfillPrice, IOrderBook.OrderExecutionMode mode, bool is2ndTrade) internal returns(uint openInterest) {
        updatePositions(order.trader); // settle funding payments
        uint quoteAsset = abs(fillAmount).toUint256() * fulfillPrice / 1e18;
        int size;
        uint openNotional;
        VarGroup memory varGroup;
        (
            varGroup.realizedPnl,
            varGroup.isPositionIncreased,
            size,
            openNotional,
            openInterest
        ) = amms[order.ammIndex].openPosition(order, fillAmount, fulfillPrice, is2ndTrade);

        {
            int toFeeSink;
            (toFeeSink, varGroup.feeCharged) = _chargeFeeAndRealizePnL(order.trader, varGroup.realizedPnl, quoteAsset, mode);
            if (toFeeSink != 0) {
                marginAccount.transferOutVusd(feeSink, toFeeSink.toUint256());
            }
        }
        {
            // isPositionIncreased is true when the position is increased or reversed
            if (varGroup.isPositionIncreased) {
                assertMarginRequirement(order.trader);
                require(order.reduceOnly == false, "CH: reduceOnly order can only reduce position");
            }
            emit PositionModified(order.trader, order.ammIndex, fillAmount, fulfillPrice, varGroup.realizedPnl, size, openNotional, varGroup.feeCharged, mode, _blockTimestamp());
        }
    }
```

## Impact
Trader can fall below the margin requirement after reducing his position size.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`assertMarginRequirement(order.trader)` should be moved out of the `if (varGroup.isPositionIncreased)` scope to ensure that trader has the required margin after reducing position size.
