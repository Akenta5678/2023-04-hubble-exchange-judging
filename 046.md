# MarginAccount.sol#_liquidateFlexible() - no check for buffer's return values

## Summary
All liquidate functions check for the return values of ``_getLiquidationInfo(trader, idx)`` in order to revert if margin account is not liquidatable, but this function does not.
## Vulnerability Detail
The additional check:
``if (buffer.status != IMarginAccount.LiquidationStatus.IS_LIQUIDATABLE) {
            revert NOT_LIQUIDATABLE(buffer.status);
 }``
isn't present in the stated function, like it's counterparts.
## Impact
A margin acc could be wrongly liquidated
