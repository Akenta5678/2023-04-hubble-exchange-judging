# `InsuranceFund._totalPoolValue` uses wrong decimals

## Summary
`InsuranceFund._totalPoolValue` doesn't take into account that chainlink returns different decimal values based on queried pairs.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function gets the total value of the AMM's
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L303-L313
It uses the `getUnderlying` or the Oracle contract
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L303-L313

Issue 1:  Chainlink returns prices with decimals based on the pair (e.g. ETH/USD returns different decimal value than BTC/ETH). Not accounting for this will lead to miscalculations

Issue 2. This price is used to calculate the `totalBalance`
Even if issue 1 did not exist, `denomDecimals` is fetched from the decimal values of the asset, which is used to calculate `totalBalance`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L311
This will most likely not be the same as the decimal values of the fetched chainlink price.
## Impact
Incorrect calculation of `totalBalance` since denomDecimals is used to calculate it

## Recommendation
Adjust decimal values of the price according to `assets[i].decimals`
