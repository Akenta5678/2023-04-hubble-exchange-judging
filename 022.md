# in MarginAccount._liquidateExactRepay() `seized` will be miscalculated if `buffer.decimals` (supported collateral token's decimal) = 1e6

## Summary
seized will be allocated miscalculated figures because the scaling of decimals neglects the fact that `buffer.decimals` (supported collateral token's decimal) could be = 1e6.

## Vulnerability Detail
taking a look at MarginAccount._liquidateExactRepay()
```solidity
 function _liquidateExactRepay(
        LiquidationBuffer memory buffer,
        address trader,
        uint repay,
        uint idx,
        uint minSeizeAmount
    )
        internal
        returns (uint seized)
    {
        // determine the seizable collateral amount on the basis of the most recent chainlink price feed
        seized = _min(
            _scaleDecimals(repay * buffer.incentivePerDollar, buffer.decimals - 6) / buffer.priceCollateral,
            // can't seize more than available
            // this also protects the liquidator in the scenario that they were front-run and only a small seize isn't worth it for them
            margin[idx][trader].toUint256()
        );
        require(seized >= minSeizeAmount, "Not seizing enough");
        _executeLiquidation(trader, repay, idx, seized, buffer.repayAble);
    }
```
At line 464, 6 is subtracted from `buffer.decimals` as a way of scaling  `buffer.decimals` (supported collateral token's decimal) that are  != 1e6

but it neglects the fact that `buffer.decimals` could be 1e6


## Impact
`seized` will be miscalculated if `buffer.decimals` (supported collateral token's decimal) is = 1e6

Manual Review

## Recommendation
adjust the scaling of decimals to include scenarios where `buffer.decimals` (supported collateral token's decimal) could be = 1e6
you can use an if statement to achieve that.
