# Static stable price is outdated in case of stable token depegs

## Summary

The report highlights a vulnerability related to stablecoins that are hardcoded by the governance. It emphasizes that static stable prices can become outdated when a stablecoin is depegged. The examples of [USDC depeg](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/02/usdcs-depeg-laid-bare-the-risks-traditional-finance-poses-to-stablecoins/) and [LUNA crash](https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/09/20/what-really-happened-to-luna-crypto/?sh=4fab9eee4ff1) are cited as instances where the statically coded stable price failed to keep up with the market price. Consequently, users' positions can become overvalued and undercollateralized, and liquidators may not be able to timely liquidate these positions. The recommendation provided is to avoid hardcoding stable prices and instead utilize a chainlink oracle.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the case of stablecoins that are hardcoded by the governance, the report points out that the static stable price can become outdated when the stablecoin is depegged. The examples of USDC depeg and LUNA crash are mentioned as instances where this vulnerability occurred. The statically coded stable price fails to accurately reflect the market price in such extreme cases. As a result, users' positions can be overvalued and undercollateralized, and liquidators are unable to promptly liquidate these unfavorable positions.

## Impact

The impact of the aforementioned vulnerability is that users' positions can become overvalued and undercollateralized. This poses risks to both the users and the stability of the system. Additionally, liquidators face challenges in liquidating these bad positions within a suitable timeframe, further exacerbating the issue.

## Code Snippet

The relevant code snippet can be found at the following location: [GitHub - Oracle.sol Line 45](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/1f9a5ed0ca8f6004bbb7b099ecbb8ae796557849/hubble-protocol/contracts/Oracle.sol#L45).

## Tool Used

The review conducted for this report was manual.

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, the report recommends avoiding the hardcoded stable price approach and instead utilizing a chainlink oracle. This would enable the system to dynamically fetch and update the stable price based on real-time market data, ensuring a more accurate representation of the current market conditions.
