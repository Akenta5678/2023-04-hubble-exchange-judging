# If user deposits less than 5 VUSD, the withdrawal will fail

## Summary
If user deposits less than 5 VUSD, the withdrawal will fail

## Vulnerability Detail
Deposit has no minimum cap on the amount. However, withdrawal has lower bound of 5 vusd.

## Impact
It's possible that the user deposits 4 vusd, and cannot withdraw the deposited amount. (Although it can be mitigated by depositing more vusd then withdraw altogether, the behavior is tricky for end users).
