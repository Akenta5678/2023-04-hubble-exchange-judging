# Malicious handling in `settleBadDebt` Function

## Summary

A critical vulnerability was found in the `settleBadDebt` function of the `MarginAccount.sol` contract. This vulnerability pertains to the handling of bad debt settlement, specifically the lack of checks in regards to the seizure of the bad debt, potentially leading to financial losses or manipulation by malicious actors.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `settleBadDebt` function is used to handle bad debt, and works as follows: if the trader has a notional position of zero and the spot collateral value is below zero, it allows for the settlement of bad debt. In the process, the function seizes the bad debt and transfers all non-zero collaterals from the trader to the insurance fund, which then starts an auction.

The vulnerability arises due to the lack of checks during the seizure of bad debt. Specifically, the function doesn't verify whether the seized amount matches the bad debt amount, nor whether the trader has sufficient collateral to cover the bad debt. As a result, a malicious actor could potentially exploit this to their advantage, potentially leading to financial losses for the platform and other users.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is substantial. If exploited, it could potentially lead to significant financial losses. Malicious actors could intentionally accumulate bad debts, and upon settlement, the seized assets might not cover the bad debt, leading to financial losses. Moreover, this could also undermine the trust in the platform and its mechanisms.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function settleBadDebt(address trader) external whenNotPaused {
        (uint256 notionalPosition,) = clearingHouse.getTotalNotionalPositionAndUnrealizedPnl(trader, 0, IClearingHouse.Mode.Min_Allowable_Margin); // last two arguments are irrelevent as we are checking only for zero/non-zero notional position in next step
        require(notionalPosition == 0, "Liquidate positions before settling bad debt");

        // The spot value of their collateral minus their vUSD obligation is a negative value
        require(getSpotCollateralValue(trader) < 0, "Above bad debt threshold");

        int vusdBal = margin[VUSD_IDX][trader];

        // this check is not strictly required because getSpotCollateralValue(trader) < 0 is a stronger assertion
        require(vusdBal < 0, "Nothing to repay");

        uint badDebt = (-vusdBal).toUint256();
        Collateral[] memory assets = supportedCollateral;

        // This pulls the obligation
        insuranceFund.seizeBadDebt(badDebt);
        margin[VUSD_IDX][trader] = 0;

        // Insurance fund gets all the available collateral
        uint[] memory seized = new uint[](assets.length);
        for (uint i = 1 /* skip vusd */; i < assets.length; i++) {
            int amount = margin[i][trader];
            if (amount > 0) {
                margin[i][trader] = 0;
                assets[i].token.safeTransfer(address(insuranceFund), amount.toUint256());
                seized[i] = amount.toUint256();
                insuranceFund.startAuction(address(assets[i].token));
            }
        }
        emit SettledBadDebt(trader, seized, badDebt, _blockTimestamp());
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to include a check that ensures the seized amount matches the bad debt amount and that the trader has enough collateral to cover the bad debt. A potential solution could involve adding a require statement checking the total value of seized assets against the bad debt value.

## Proof Of Concept

To demonstrate this vulnerability, consider the following scenario on a mainnet fork:

1. Assume there are two assets: `Asset_A` and `Asset_B`, with `Asset_A` being used as collateral.
2. A user opens a highly leveraged long position on `Asset_B` using `Asset_A` as collateral. The user's position is now highly risky, and a small drop in the price of `Asset_B` could lead to a margin call.
3. The price of `Asset_B` drops significantly in the market, leading to the user's collateral (`Asset_A`) to become insufficient to cover the user's debts (the value of `Asset_B` they are holding is less than the borrowed amount). Now, the user has bad debt.
4. The `settleBadDebt` function is triggered (either by the user or someone else). This function will seize the remaining collateral `Asset_A` from the user and transfer it to the insurance fund, starting an auction. 
5. At this point, measure the total value of the seized `Asset_A` (which can be done by querying the `seized` array or checking the balance of `Asset_A` in the insurance fund).
6. Compare this value with the initial bad debt (the borrowed amount of `Asset_B` minus its current market value). 
7. It will be observed that the seized assets do not cover the bad debt. In essence, the loss from the bad debt is greater than the value of the seized assets, leading to a financial discrepancy in the smart contract.
   
This scenario demonstrates the vulnerability where the seized assets are not checked against the bad debt, leading to potential financial losses to the platform.
