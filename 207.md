# Too low auction price will result in a great losses for the protocol.

## Summary
Due unrestricted  auction price , the protocol will retrieve only small amounts from auctions.

## Vulnerability Detail
To determine Vusd amount for auction , amount to pay is multiplied by the price of the auction then divided by required decimals. This price is achieved as shown below.

 function _getAuctionPrice(Auction memory auction) internal view returns (uint) {
        uint diff = auction.startPrice * (_blockTimestamp() - auction.startedAt) / auctionDuration;
        return auction.startPrice - diff;
    }
         Example
Given a startprice = 1000$, 
              ( blocktimestamp - auctionstartedat ) = 30 mins 
              auction duration = 2hrs 
Diff = 1000 * 30 / 120 , which is  250$
now auction price will be,  1000 $ - 250$ = 750 $.

 However,  if ( blocktimestamp - auctionstartedat ) = 117 mins , ( since auction duration is always 2 hrs )  :
Diff = 1000 * 117 / 120 , which is 975 $ 
now  auction price will be, 1000$ - 975 $ = 25 $

 What this means is that , to achieve more profits buyers will wait lets say more than 100 mins after seeing the start time of the auction then initiate a  buy  collateral from auction process which result in the protocol selling collateral at a very cheap price hence  small amounts being recouped from auction.


## Impact
The protocol might incur great losses and in the end get undercollarized.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider reducing the auction duration time or introduce a threshold  mirroring the price of the collateral  . This will ensure the auction price does not deviate too much from the start price  while also buyers can still be incentivized to purchase auctions.
