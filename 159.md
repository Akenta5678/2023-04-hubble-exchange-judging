# [MEDIUM] ClearingHouse#updatePositions - Lack of Enforced Order in Function Calls

## Summary
The `updatePositions` function must be called every time after `settleFunding` to keep the `lastFundingPaid[trader]` value updated to match `lastFundingTime`. However, the current implementation does not enforce this order, which could lead to a discrepancy between these two values.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `settleFunding` function updates the `lastFundingTime` value, representing the latest time funding was settled. The `updatePositions` function, on the other hand, is supposed to update `lastFundingPaid[trader]` to the `lastFundingTime` for each trader. However, there is no guarantee in the code that `updatePositions` will be called immediately after `settleFunding`. This lack of guaranteed order can lead to a situation where lastFundingTime is more recent than `lastFundingPaid[trader]`.

## Impact
Currently, these specific variables are not used elsewhere in the contract, so the impact of this discrepancy might be minimal. However, it is crucial to consider future updates. If these values are used for any calculations or processes in future versions of the contract, this discrepancy could lead to significant problems, depending on the context.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L241C2-L241C2

```solidity
function settleFunding(IAMM _amm) internal {
    ...
    lastFundingTime = _blockTimestamp();
    ...
}

function updatePositions(address trader, Position memory position) internal {
    ...
    if (lastFundingPaid[trader] != lastFundingTime) {
        lastFundingPaid[trader] = lastFundingTime;
    }
    ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforce the call to `updatePositions` within the `settleFunding` function for all traders. This enforcement could be done by calling `updatePositions` directly from `settleFunding` or using an event-driven model where an event emitted by `settleFunding` triggers `updatePositions`.
