# User can transfer 1 wei of token to prevent auction from ending then purchase the collateral in a far too discounted and outdated price

## Summary

The report identifies a flaw in the auction design, which can be exploited to manipulate the auction and purchase collateral at a heavily discounted and outdated price. The vulnerability is described in detail, along with code snippets demonstrating the issue. The impact of this vulnerability is that users can game the auction and acquire collateral at significantly lower prices than their actual market value. The report recommends querying the market price of the collateral using Chainlink or a similar oracle to ensure fair and up-to-date prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability lies in the following code snippet of the buyCollateralFromAuction function:

```solidity
    function buyCollateralFromAuction(address token, uint amount) override external {
        Auction memory auction = auctions[token];
        // validate auction

        require(_isAuctionOngoing(auction.startedAt, auction.expiryTime), "IF.no_ongoing_auction");

        // transfer funds
        uint vusdToTransfer = _calcVusdAmountForAuction(auction, token, amount);
        address buyer = _msgSender();
        vusd.safeTransferFrom(buyer, address(this), vusdToTransfer);
        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(buyer, amount); // will revert if there wasn't enough amount as requested

        if (IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) == 0) {
            auctions[token].startedAt = 0;
        }
    }
```

The flaw is that when the balance of the token in the auction contract becomes zero, the startedAt state of the auction is cleared. This can be exploited by transferring a small amount (1 wei) of the token to prevent the auction from ending. As a result, users can purchase the collateral at a discounted price based on the outdated auction price. 

The issue affects the settleBadDebt function in the MarginAccount.sol contract as well, where collateral is transferred to the InsurancePool:

```solidity
if (IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) == 0) {
	auctions[token].startedAt = 0;
}
```

With two hour auctionDuration without pricec update, the price is considered very oudated

```solidity
   auctionDuration = 2 hours;
```

Moreover, the auction price becomes cheaper as the auction approaches its end, further incentivizing users to exploit this vulnerability.

```solidity
    function _getAuctionPrice(Auction memory auction) internal view returns (uint) {
        uint diff = auction.startPrice * (_blockTimestamp() - auction.startedAt) / auctionDuration;
        return auction.startPrice - diff;
    }
```

The vulnerability has a further impact on the settleBadDebt function in the MarginAccount.sol contract. The snippet below shows how collateral is transferred to the InsurancePool:

```solidity
 function settleBadDebt(address trader) external whenNotPaused {
```

and

```solidity
    // Insurance fund gets all the available collateral
        uint[] memory seized = new uint[](assets.length);
        for (uint i = 1 /* skip vusd */; i < assets.length; i++) {
            int amount = margin[i][trader];
            if (amount > 0) {
                margin[i][trader] = 0;
                assets[i].token.safeTransfer(address(insuranceFund), amount.toUint256());
                seized[i] = amount.toUint256();
                insuranceFund.startAuction(address(assets[i].token));
            }
        }
```


## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that users can manipulate the auction mechanism to their advantage. By transferring a small amount of the token to keep the auction active, users can purchase collateral at a heavily discounted price based on outdated auction prices. Over time, this can lead to significant financial losses for the platform if the purchased collateral does not cover the bad debt.

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The report recommends implementing a solution to query the market price of the collateral using Chainlink or a similar oracle. By obtaining the real-time market price, the auction process can be safeguarded against manipulation and ensure fair prices for both buyers and sellers.

Here are the suggested steps to address the vulnerability:

1. Integrate a reliable oracle solution such as Chainlink to obtain the up-to-date market price of the collateral token.
2. Modify the `buyCollateralFromAuction` function to utilize the oracle to fetch the current market price of the collateral token.
3. Calculate the fair value of the collateral based on the current market price obtained from the oracle.
4. Implement slippage protection to prevent users from purchasing the collateral at excessively discounted prices.
5. Update the auction process to consider the real-time market price, ensuring that users cannot exploit outdated prices.
6. Regularly update the auction prices to reflect current market conditions and prevent manipulation.

By incorporating these recommendations, the auction mechanism can be significantly strengthened, ensuring fair prices and protecting the platform from potential exploits.

Additionally, it is essential to conduct thorough testing and auditing of the updated code to verify the effectiveness of the proposed changes and identify any potential vulnerabilities that may arise from the modifications.

Taking these steps will help create a more secure and resilient auction system, mitigating the risk of users gaming the auctions and acquiring collateral at heavily discounted and outdated prices.
