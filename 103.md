# In HGT.sol contract, Avoid using .transfer() and violation of Checks,Effects and Interaction pattern in _creditTo() function (Sponsor acknowledged)

## Summary
call() should be used instead of transfer() on an address payable and always follow CEI pattern.

## Vulnerability Detail
The transfer() and send() functions forward a fixed amount of 2300 gas. Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs. For example. EIP 1884 broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.

In HGT.sol, 

```Solidity
File: contracts/HGT.sol

32    function _creditTo(address _toAddress, uint _amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused returns(uint) {
33        // check for amount and user
34        require(
35            _amount != 0 && _toAddress != address(0x0),
36            "HGT: Insufficient amount or invalid user"
37        );
38
39        // scale amount to 18 decimals
40        _amount *= SCALING_FACTOR;
41
42        // transfer amount to user
43        payable(_toAddress).transfer(_amount);
44
45        circulatingSupply += _amount;
46        return _amount;
47    }
```
**There are two major issue here-** 

Issue 1 - Use of transfer() and the its impact is explained below.

Issue 2- _creditTo() function Violates Checks,Effects and Interaction pattern which it must follow. It is recommended to always follow CEI pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.

## Impact
The use of the deprecated transfer() function for an address will inevitably make the transaction fail when:
• The claimer smart contract does not implement a payable function.
• The claimer smart contract does implement a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit.
• The claimer smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300.
• Additionally, using higher than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.

>Question 2: 
In HGT.sol,
_creditTo()

```Solidity
> payable(_toAddress).transfer(_amount);
```

>transfer() is not recommended as it has 2300 gas limit......as you know ethereum protocol is improving with lots of changes being proposed. The gas limits can be changed in future. Infact in past gas limits had been modified. Therefore it can be said the gas limits can be modified in future too.
>+ Use of transfer() is deprecated and had been advised by big audit firms like Consensys to avoid usage of deprecated transfer().
Recommended mitigation is to use ....... call() function.

## Recommendation
Use call() instead of transfer(), but be sure to respect the CEI pattern.

```Solidity

   function _creditTo(address _toAddress, uint _amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused returns(uint) {
        // check for amount and user
        require(
            _amount != 0 && _toAddress != address(0x0),
            "HGT: Insufficient amount or invalid user"
        );

        // scale amount to 18 decimals
        _amount *= SCALING_FACTOR;

        // transfer amount to user
-        payable(_toAddress).transfer(_amount);

-        circulatingSupply += _amount;

+        circulatingSupply += _amount;
+        (bool success, ) = payable(_toAddress).call{value:_amount)("");
+         require(success, "transfer failed");

        return _amount;
    }
```
