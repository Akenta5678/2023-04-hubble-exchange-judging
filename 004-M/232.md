# Value could be zero if answer < 100 in Oracle.sol#getUnderlyingPrice

## Summary
The `getUnderlyingPrice()` function in the Oracle contract is vulnerable to returning a zero price when the value retrieved from the AggregatorV3Interface's `latestRoundData()` function is less than `100`. This vulnerability can lead to incorrect price calculations and impact the accuracy of the protocol's functions that rely on accurate price feeds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises when the `latestRoundData()` function call returns a value less than `100` for the answer. In such cases, the function does not handle this scenario, and the subsequent division operation `answer /= 100;` can result in a zero price. This can lead to incorrect calculations and misrepresent the actual price of the underlying asset.

## Impact
Incorrect valuation of assets based on underestimated prices. It is important to inform them that the possibility of the `answer` being less than `100` has become significantly low, but this factor should be considered when depegging the underlying asset.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to modify the `getUnderlyingPrice()` function to handle cases where the answer value is less than `100`. One approach is to introduce a minimum threshold for the answer value and ensure it is above zero before performing the division operation. This can be achieved by changing the require statement with below code:

```solidity
require(answer >= 100, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.low_answer");
```
