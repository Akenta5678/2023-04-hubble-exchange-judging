# An outrageously different price could be used in the case where all of the last hour data is negative in `getRoundData()`


## Summary

This check is included in the [getLatestRoundData()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/1f9a5ed0ca8f6004bbb7b099ecbb8ae796557849/hubble-protocol/contracts/Oracle.sol#L106-L141) function:

```solidity
  function getLatestRoundData(AggregatorV3Interface _aggregator)
...
        if (latestPrice <= 0) {
            requireEnoughHistory(round);
            (round, finalPrice, latestTimestamp) = getRoundData(_aggregator, round - 1);
        }
...
}
```

Key to note that this function is used for the twap calculation of last hour, problem is that if all of last hour data is negative then the `last positive price` is used, this is obviously an issue as if all instance for the twap price of the last hour is `-ve,` a revert should instead be the best case, than potentially valuing the token at a very outrageous price, since it got worthless already

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary, take a look at the [getLatestRoundData()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/1f9a5ed0ca8f6004bbb7b099ecbb8ae796557849/hubble-protocol/contracts/Oracle.sol#L106-L141) function

```solidity


    function getLatestRoundData(AggregatorV3Interface _aggregator)
        internal
        view
        returns (
            uint80,
            uint256 finalPrice,
            uint256
        )
    {
        (uint80 round, int256 latestPrice, , uint256 latestTimestamp, ) = _aggregator.latestRoundData();
        finalPrice = uint256(latestPrice);
        if (latestPrice <= 0) {
            requireEnoughHistory(round);
            (round, finalPrice, latestTimestamp) = getRoundData(_aggregator, round - 1);
        }
        return (round, finalPrice, latestTimestamp);
    }


    function getRoundData(AggregatorV3Interface _aggregator, uint80 _round)
        internal
        view
        returns (
            uint80,
            uint256,
            uint256
        )
    {
        (uint80 round, int256 latestPrice, , uint256 latestTimestamp, ) = _aggregator.getRoundData(_round);
        while (latestPrice <= 0) {
            requireEnoughHistory(round);
            round = round - 1;
            (, latestPrice, , latestTimestamp, ) = _aggregator.getRoundData(round);
        }
        return (round, uint256(latestPrice), latestTimestamp);
    }
```

## Impact

Potentially valuing already worthless tokens
