# Transaction will still go through despite negative VUSD balance

## Summary
The realizePnL function directly credits or debits the PnL (Profit and Loss) amount to the trader's VUSD (Virtual USD) balance without checking if it can lead to a negative balance
## Vulnerability Detail
This means that if the realized PnL is negative and it results in a negative VUSD balance for the trader, the transaction will still go through, potentially causing the trader's VUSD balance to become negative
A negative VUSD balance implies that the trader owes more VUSD than they have in their account. It can lead to an unbalanced state and potential issues when processing further transactions or performing other operations that rely on the VUSD balance.
## Impact
The trader's debt would increase, and they would owe more VUSD than they actually have. This could potentially result in the loss of their collateral or trigger liquidation events if the account becomes unprofitable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add modifications which checks if the new balance after realizing the PnL is greater than or equal to zero. If the new balance would be negative, the function reverts with an error message stating "Insufficient VUSD balance." This prevents the PnL from being directly credited or debited if it would lead to a negative balance
