# First depositor can break minting of shares

## Summary
It is possible for an attacker to front-run a user's deposit transaction and increase the share price to a higher value by transferring tokens directly to the `InsuranceFund` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositFor` function in the `InsuranceFund` contract mints an initial share equal to the deposited amount.
The further minting depends on the equation `shares = amount * totalSupply() / _totalPoolValue()`
The `_totalPoolValue` function sums up the values of all supported assets that the `InsuranceFund` contract possesses.

Let's assume the following simplified scenario:

1. The attacker deposits an amount of 1 (the smallest unit of VUSD). One share is minted, and the _totalPoolValue function returns 1.
2. The attacker directly transfers 1000 VUSD to the InsuranceFund contract. The _totalPoolValue function returns 1000e6+1.
3. The user deposits 500 VUSD. Due to rounding, 0 shares will be minted.
4. The attacker withdraws their one share and receives the entire pool balance.

## Impact
User can lost their deposit.
## Code Snippet
[InsuranceFund.sol#L89-L110](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L89-L110)
```solidity
    function depositFor(address to, uint amount) override public {
        settlePendingObligation();
        // we want to protect new LPs, when the insurance fund is in deficit
        require(pendingObligation == 0, "IF.deposit.pending_obligations");

        uint _pool = _totalPoolValue();
        uint _totalSupply = totalSupply();
        uint vusdBalance = balance();
        if (_totalSupply == 0 && vusdBalance > 0) { // trading fee accumulated while there were no IF LPs
            vusd.safeTransfer(governance(), vusdBalance);
            _pool = 0;
        }

        vusd.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount);
        uint shares = 0;
        if (_pool == 0) {
            shares = amount;
        } else {
            shares = amount * _totalSupply / _pool;
        }
        _mint(to, shares);
        emit FundsAdded(to, amount, _blockTimestamp());
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use virtual offset mechanism as implemented in the new update of OpenZeppelinâ€™s ERC-4626 contract.
Restrict the minting zero shares.
