# InsuranceFund.sol#unbondShares() - loss of precision when calculating unbondTime

## Summary
The ``unbondShares()`` function of the IF contract is supposed to queue a withdrawal for ``unbondTime`` time, which is rounded using a calculation that divides before multiplying.

## Vulnerability Detail
``uint unbondTime = ((_now + unbondPeriod) / unbondRoundOff) * unbondRoundOff;``
Dividing by the ``unbondRoundOff`` first will lead to a loss of precision which lowers the value of the calculation.
## Impact
Unexpected earlier withdrawals of LP.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Swap operations so multiplication comes first.
