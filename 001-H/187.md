# Manipulating minted share amount and share price by directly transferring asset to the InsuranceFundPool.sol

## Summary

The report highlights a vulnerability in the code that can lead to the manipulation of share prices. The vulnerability is described in detail along with code snippets demonstrating the issue. The impact is that users can exploit the vulnerability to manipulate share prices. The report suggests a recommendation to address the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Detail

The solidity code snippet below shows the `pricePerShare` function, which calculates the price per share:

```solidity
function pricePerShare() external view returns (uint) {
    uint _totalSupply = totalSupply();
    uint _balance = balance();

    _balance -= Math.min(_balance, pendingObligation);
    if (_totalSupply == 0 || _balance == 0) {
        return PRECISION;
    }
    return _balance * PRECISION / _totalSupply;
}
```

The vulnerability is related to the `balance()` function, which is called by `pricePerShare`. Here is the code for the `balance()` function:

```solidity
function balance() public view returns (uint) {
    return vusd.balanceOf(address(this));
}
```

The report states that the share price can be inflated by transferring `vusd` directly to the contract. Additionally, when calling the `mint` function, the `_pool` value is calculated using the `_totalPoolValue()` function, which is defined as follows:

```solidity
function _totalPoolValue() internal view returns (uint totalBalance) {
    IMarginAccount.Collateral[] memory assets = IMarginAccount(marginAccount).supportedAssets();

    // decimal scaling is wrong
    for (uint i; i < assets.length; i++) {
        uint _balance = IERC20(address(assets[i].token)).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (_balance == 0) continue;

        uint numerator = _balance * uint(oracle.getUnderlyingPrice(address(assets[i].token)));
        uint denomDecimals = assets[i].decimals;

        totalBalance += (numerator / 10 ** denomDecimals);
    }
}
```

The report further explains that users can exploit this vulnerability by transferring assets to mint a large number of shares or by transferring `vusd` to inflate the share price and withdraw a large amount of assets.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that the share price can be manipulated by exploiting the described vulnerabilities.

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The report recommends tracking the balance using state instead of calling `balanceOf` to mitigate the vulnerability.
