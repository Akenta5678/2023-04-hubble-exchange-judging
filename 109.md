# HGT debits more assets than specified in _amount

## Summary

When calling `HGT.withdraw()`, the `_debitFrom` function debits an extra wei unnecessarily

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `_debitFrom` function, the `amount` is manually rounded down. This is unnecessary (confirmed w/ sponsor) as

1. solidity automatically rounds down
2. if itâ€™s a clean division i.e. numerator % divisor = 0

Moreover, because of the requirement that amount > 1, a user can never withdraw exactly 1 token.

## Impact

User receives `amount-1` wei of tokens. This off by 1 error can potentially be disastrous depending on how the receiving contract handles it and the imbalance can build up over time.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the logic that rounds down
```solidity
function _debitFrom(address, uint _amount) internal virtual override returns(uint) {
    circulatingSupply -= _amount;
    _amount = _amount / SCALING_FACTOR;
    return _amount;
}
```
