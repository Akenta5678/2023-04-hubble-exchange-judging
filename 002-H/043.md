# The processWithdrawals function may cause users can't withdraw their funds forever

## Summary
The `processWithdrawals` function in `VUSD.sol` doesn't handle if `call` function failed, this will cause users can't withdraw their funds forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `processWithdrawals` function will uses the `withdrawals` to transfer value to users with `call`:
```solidity
VUSD.sol
    /**
     * @notice Process withdrawals in the queue. Sends gas token to the user.
    */
    function processWithdrawals() external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        uint reserve = address(this).balance;
        require(reserve >= withdrawals[start].amount, 'Cannot process withdrawals at this time: Not enough balance');
        uint i = start;
        while (i < withdrawals.length && (i - start) < maxWithdrawalProcesses) {
            Withdrawal memory withdrawal = withdrawals[i];
            if (reserve < withdrawal.amount) {
                break;
            }

            (bool success, bytes memory data) = withdrawal.usr.call{value: withdrawal.amount}(""); // <--here
            if (success) {
                reserve -= withdrawal.amount;
            } else {
                emit WithdrawalFailed(withdrawal.usr, withdrawal.amount, data);
            }
            i += 1;
        }
        // re-entracy not possible, hence can update `start` at the end
        start = i;
    }
```
But if `call` failed, it will skip this `withdrawal` and continue, last update `start`. And the next call to `processWithdrawals` won't handle the failed `withdrawal`. This will cause users to never be able to withdraw their funds.

## Impact
Users can't withdraw their funds forever.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the logic of `processWithdrawals`, starting from the head of `withdrawals` every time, when the `call` is successful, delete the current `withdrawal` from the `withdrawals`. When the `call` fails, the `withdrawal` is kept and a new round of attempts is made on the next call of the `processWithdrawals` function.
