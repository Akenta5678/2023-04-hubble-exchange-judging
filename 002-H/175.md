# User won't receive vusd when withdrawing if balance vusd of InsuranceFund == 0

## Summary
When burning LP's while vusd balance == 0, LP's will get burned while not receiving vusd
## Vulnerability Detail
When withdrawing, `_withdrawFor` is called and handles everything

To determine how much vusd should be sent to the user this calculation is used: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L215
which is fine
There's a legit scenario where the balance of vusd can be 0. 
This will result in the following calculation: `(0 * shares) / totalSupply` = 0.

The problem is that the code does not revert when this happens. The shares are burnt and the user won't receive any shares since 0 transfers are supported.
## Impact
User could lose his shares while not receiving anything

## Recommendation
revert on 0 transfer for implement a debt mechanism where users can withdraw if balance is increased
