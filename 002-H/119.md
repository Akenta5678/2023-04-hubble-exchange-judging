# processWithdrawals failure causes user funds to be permanently locked

## Summary

When processWithdrawals fails to process some withdraw, trigger a fail event, and skip it to process the next withdraw, causing user funds to be permanently locked.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function initialize(string memory name, string memory symbol) public override virtual {
        super.initialize(name, symbol); // has initializer modifier
        _revokeRole(MINTER_ROLE, _msgSender()); // __ERC20PresetMinterPauser_init_unchained grants this but is not required
        maxWithdrawalProcesses = 100;
    }

    function processWithdrawals() external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        uint reserve = address(this).balance;
        require(reserve >= withdrawals[start].amount, 'Cannot process withdrawals at this time: Not enough balance');
        uint i = start;
        while (i < withdrawals.length && (i - start) < maxWithdrawalProcesses) {
            Withdrawal memory withdrawal = withdrawals[i];
            if (reserve < withdrawal.amount) {
                break;
            }

            (bool success, bytes memory data) = withdrawal.usr.call{value: withdrawal.amount}("");
            if (success) {
                reserve -= withdrawal.amount;
            } else {
                emit WithdrawalFailed(withdrawal.usr, withdrawal.amount, data);
            }
            i += 1;
        }
        // re-entracy not possible, hence can update `start` at the end
        start = i;
    }

    function _withdrawTo(address to, uint amount) internal {
        require(amount >= 5 * (10 ** PRECISION), "min withdraw is 5 vusd");
        burn(amount); // burn vusd from msg.sender
        withdrawals.push(Withdrawal(to, amount * SCALING_FACTOR));
    }
```

1. Users invoke `_withdrawTo` to withdraw USDC and burn VUSD, waiting in the queue for processing
2. Keepers invoke `processWithdrawals`, if user calls fail, skip it and process next one
3. There is no way to re-execute these failed cases

Note that VUSD removes the minter role at the beginning, and while admin can add it again, it probably won't, so there will be no off-chain recovery. User funds are permanently locked in the contract

## Impact

processWithdrawals failure causes user funds to be permanently locked

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If the withdrawal fails, the corresponding amount of VUSD should be re-minted for the user
