# No way to handle failed withdrawals

## Summary
If a withdrawal fails, the contract just emits an event and continues. This can cause a user's funds to be stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the contract tries to transfer the withdrawn amount to a user, it uses a low-level .call function. The success of this operation is stored in the success variable. If the call fails for some reason, the success value will be false.

In this case, the contract simply emits a WithdrawalFailed event and moves on to the next withdrawal. It does not try to reprocess the failed withdrawal later, and it does not have a function that would allow a user or an admin to trigger a retry of the failed withdrawal.

## Impact
If a withdrawal fails, the corresponding amount of funds is effectively stuck in the contract. The user cannot retrieve it.
