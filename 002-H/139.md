# Failed withdrawal cannot be replayed

## Summary
If a withdrawal fails via low-level call, it cannot be replayed, leading to permanently lost funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
When withdrawals are processed via `VUSD.processWithdrawals()`, the withdrawal records in the `withdrawals` queue are looped through and gas token is transferred via low-level call. In the case that the low-level call fails, an event is emitted and the withdrawal record is skipped.

There is no ability for the recipient to call back into the contract to receive the gas token that failed to transfer. Low-level call reverts can happen for a variety of reasons, including:
- Failure due to logic in a fallback function that is dependent on the time in which it's called
- Failure of the recipient contract to implement a payable fallback, but the contract can be upgraded to do so.

## Impact
- Permanent loss of withdrawal funds

## Recommendation
Add failed withdrawals to a separate mapping that the recipient can retrieve at a future time.
