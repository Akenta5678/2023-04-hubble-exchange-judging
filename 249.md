# Potential DOS condition due to exceeding block gas limit when calling `ClearingHouse.settleFunding()`

## Summary

With a rising number of supported markets, `ClearingHouse.settleFunding()` can potentially reach a point, where it exceeds the block gas limit on Avalanche C-Chain, leading to a potential DOS condition.

## Vulnerability Detail

First `ClearingHouse.settleFunding()` is called, which iterates over all markets, calling `amms[i].settleFunding()` for each market:

Then inside `AMM.settleFunding()` the underlying twap price is determined:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/Oracle.sol#L76

Especially inside the oracle code (line 76) there is a gas expensive `while (true)` that might exceed the block gas limit, when there are many markets for which the unterlying twap price has to be fetched.

Note: A gas issue with `ClearingHouse.settleFunding()` was already reported in a previous audit, where the function `Amm._calcTwap` back then caused a very high gas consumption according to the profiler. The `Amm._calcTwap()` and it's `while (true)` loop functionality, which is very gas intensive, was then refactored into `Oracle.getUnderlyingTwapPrice()` (line 76 Oracle.sol), where the code is very identical and the potential excess of available block gas will still occur if many markets are being supported.

## Impact

Potential DOS condition when calling `ClearingHouse.settleFunding()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding functionality to settle funding per market or per an array of markets, to mitigate exceeding the block gas limit when having a high number of supported markets.
