# VUSD's withdrawal request can be skipped if reserve has not enough balance at the moment of processing --> Users can get DoS

## Summary
VUSD's withdrawal request can be skipped if reserve has not enough balance at the moment of withdrawal processing

## Vulnerability Detail
`processWithdrawals` function will loop through each withdrawal request made, and will try to process if there's sufficient remaining balance. However, if the balance is insufficient, a fail event will be emitted and the request will simply be skipped (and will never be re-processed again).

## Impact
- The withdrawal request made can be frontrunned by other users --> it's possible that every time the user who wanted to withdrawal can always be frontrunned so that the remaining balance is always insufficient -> cannot withdraw forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Possible mitigations are:
1. always ensure balance is available for withdraw, or
2. re-queue the failed ones (append the withdrawal request if the request fails instead of just skipping).
