# latestRoundData() doesn't check for stale prices

## Summary
`getUnderlyingPrice()` gets the latest price by calling `latestRoundData()` from the specific chainlink aggregator for each underlying asset, but does not cross-check the `updatedAt` timestamp returned with the `answer` price to verify the protocol doesn't use stale prices.
## Vulnerability Detail
According to the [chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits:~:text=Check%20the%20timestamp,risk%20mitigation%20practices.), when calling `latestRoundData()`, apart from the `answer` value, the `updatedAt` value should also be returned and compared to the latest timestamp to make sure the application isn't using stale prices.

```Solidity
    function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
        virtual
        external
        view
        returns(int256 answer)
    {
        if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
            return stablePrice[underlying];
        }


        (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();

        require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
        answer /= 100;
    }
```
