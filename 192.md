# No checks for whether Arbitrum sequencer is down

## Summary
There are no checks in the Oracle code that ensure that the Arbitrum sequencer is up.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol plans to deploy on EVM-compatible chains like Arbitrum. So, when utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down.

## Impact
If the sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow its users to keep using the stale rates.
