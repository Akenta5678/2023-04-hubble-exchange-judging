# use of `transfer()` instead of `call()` to send `ETH`

## Summary
Use of transfer instead of call to send ETH, where transfer has a fixed gas cost.

## Vulnerability Detail
In HTG.sol _creditTo function.
```solidity
   // transfer amount to user
        payable(_toAddress).transfer(_amount);
```
Use of transfer() might render ETH impossible to withdraw because, after Istanbul's hard fork, there was an increase in the gas cost of the SLOAD operation and therefore breaks some existing smart contracts. Those contracts will break because their fallback functions used to consume less than 2300 gas, and they’ll now consume more since 2300 is the amount of gas a contract’s fallback function receives if it’s called via Solidity’s transfer() or send() methods.
Any smart contract that uses transfer() or send() is taking a hard dependency on gas costs by forwarding a fixed amount of gas: 2300.

## Impact
Since gas costs are subject to change, smart contracts can’t depend on any particular gas costs.
Any smart contract that uses transfer() or send() is taking a hard dependency on gas costs by forwarding a fixed amount of gas: 2300.
