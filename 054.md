# In Oracle.sol, getUnderlyingPrice() could have wrong decimals which further cause wrong prices

## Summary
In Oracle.sol, getUnderlyingPrice() could have wrong decimals

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In Oracle.sol,

```Solidity
File: contracts/Oracle.sol

24    function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
25        virtual
26        external
27        view
28        returns(int256 answer)
29    {
30        if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
31            return stablePrice[underlying];
32        }
33        (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
34        require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
35        answer /= 100;
36    }
```

At L-35, The Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice() function divides the chainlink price by 100. It most probably assumes that the answer for the underlying is in 8 decimals but then wants to reduce it for 6 decimals to match USDC.

**However, arbitrary underlying tokens are used and the chainlink oracles can have different decimals.**

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Most USD price feeds use 8 decimals, it's better to take the on-chain reported decimals by chainlink into account by doing 

```Solidity
AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).decimals(),
```

**The chainlink return price should then be scaled down to 6 decimals.** 

This solution will prevent wrong decimals issue which can cause wrong prices. Asserting the above check will be the best soldution when adding a new asset too.
