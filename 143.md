# Chainlinkâ€™s latestRoundData might return stale or incorrect results

## Summary
This vulnerability report highlights a potential security issue related to the usage of latestRoundData() from the AggregatorV3Interface in the code snippet provided. The vulnerability arises when Chainlink encounters difficulties starting a new round or achieving consensus on the oracle value, which can result in consumers of the contract utilizing outdated, stale, or incorrect data. The report outlines the vulnerability details, potential impact, the code snippet causing the issue, the manual review approach, and provides recommendations for mitigation.

## Vulnerability Detail
This vulnerability report highlights a potential security issue related to the usage of latestRoundData() from the AggregatorV3Interface in the code snippet provided. The vulnerability arises when Chainlink encounters difficulties starting a new round or achieving consensus on the oracle value, which can result in consumers of the contract utilizing outdated, stale, or incorrect data. The report outlines the vulnerability details, potential impact, the code snippet causing the issue, the manual review approach, and provides recommendations for mitigation.

## Impact
Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to potential inaccuracies in the pricing data used by the contract. If stale or incorrect data is utilized, it can result in incorrect calculations, decision-making, or actions performed by the contract. This can have adverse effects on the overall functionality, reliability, and fairness of the system.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/Oracle.sol#L33

       (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
        require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/Oracle.sol#L116

      (uint80 round, int256 latestPrice, , uint256 latestTimestamp, ) = _aggregator.latestRoundData();
        finalPrice = uint256(latestPrice);
        if (latestPrice <= 0) {
            requireEnoughHistory(round);
            (round, finalPrice, latestTimestamp) = getRoundData(_aggregator, round - 1);
        }
        return (round, finalPrice, latestTimestamp);


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement additional checks on the retrieved data: Add the following checks to ensure the validity and freshness of the price data obtained from Chainlink's latestRoundData() function:

    require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round");
   require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
