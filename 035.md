# InsuranceFund.sol#_getAuctionPrice() - auction type and price are unfitting for the needs of the protocol

## Summary
The InsuranceFund.sol contract is, as stated in the documentation, used to settle any bad debt created in the system. It uses auctions to sell seized collateral to users, further increasing the funds reserve and ability to settle the bad debt. The issue is the type of auction, which is unfitted for the needs of the protocol. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract uses an English Auction mechanism - the price increases proportionally to the time elapsed since the beginning of the auction with the starting price set at the current price of the underlying asset (token passed as argument). This creates the scenario in which the collateral in the auction is never sold, since it's price would strive higher than the market price of the asset, making it unlikely to be sold.
## Impact
The collateral would never be sold, which would hurt the IF contracts reserves, which could lead to hurting it's contribution to the protocl.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a Dutch Auction mechanism to incentivize users to buy the collateral from the auction, instead of a regular market.
