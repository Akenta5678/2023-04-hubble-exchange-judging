# External Call

## Summary
### Anyone who can initializes the InsuranceFund.sol contract he can make call to an external contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone who can initializes the InsuranceFund.sol contract he can make call to an external contract by passing his own contract (governance).
1. we can pass our address as [governance](https://github.com/hubble-exchange/hubble-protocol/blob/d89714101dd3494b132a3e3f9fed9aca4e19aef6/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L68) param in initialize function
2. we call [syncDeps](https://github.com/hubble-exchange/hubble-protocol/blob/d89714101dd3494b132a3e3f9fed9aca4e19aef6/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L321) because now we are governance and pass our contract address to retreve bad vusd address.
3. now we call [depositFor](https://github.com/hubble-exchange/hubble-protocol/blob/d89714101dd3494b132a3e3f9fed9aca4e19aef6/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L89) function to use SafeERC20.sol [safeTransfer](https://github.com/hubble-exchange/hubble-protocol/blob/d89714101dd3494b132a3e3f9fed9aca4e19aef6/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L98) function 
4. then `safeTransfer` will call `_callOptionalReturn` then it will call Address.sol `functionCallWithValue`.
5. `functionCallWithValue` will use this line `target.call{value: value}(data);` wich means we can call external contract using `InsuranceFund logic contract` which could be dangerous.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent the logic contract from being used, you should invoke the __disableInitialze(); function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed.
