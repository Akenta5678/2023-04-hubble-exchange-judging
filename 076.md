# Preventing bypass of unbonding time limit for share withdrawals

## Summary
This exploit allows users to mint new shares, transfer them to another address, and immediately unbond them without waiting for the intended unbonding time to elapse. It circumvents the purpose of the unbonding mechanism, which is typically implemented to prevent users from withdrawing funds immediately after minting or purchasing them.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `unbondShares()` function allows users to unbond a certain number of shares and records the unbonding timestamp. However, if a user performs the following steps, they can potentially exploit the system:

Call the unbondShares function and provide a number of shares to unbond.
Transfer the shares to another address.
Call the unbondShares function again with the new address.
By following this sequence, the user effectively bypasses the unbonding time limit. When the user transfers the shares to a different address, the ownership of the shares changes. As a result, when the unbondShares function is called again with the new address, it will check the balance of that address and allow the user to unbond the shares without adhering to the original unbonding time limit.
```solidity
    function unbondShares(uint shares) external {
        address usr = _msgSender();
        require(shares <= balanceOf(usr), "unbonding_too_much");
        uint _now = _blockTimestamp();
        uint unbondTime = ((_now + unbondPeriod) / unbondRoundOff) * unbondRoundOff;
        unbond[usr] = UnbondInfo(shares, unbondTime);
        emit Unbonded(usr, shares, unbondTime, _now);
    }
```

## Impact
Circumvention of Unbonding Time: Users can exploit this vulnerability to bypass the intended unbonding time limit. They can quickly transfer newly minted shares to another address and then immediately unbond them, without waiting for the specified unbonding time period. This undermines the purpose of the unbonding mechanism, which is designed to impose a time delay for security or liquidity reasons.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Transfer Lock: Implement a transfer lock mechanism that prevents shares from being transferred to another address immediately after being minted. This lock should enforce a waiting period before shares can be transferred, ensuring that the unbonding time limit is maintained.
