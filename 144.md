# Insurance Fund shares are not calculated correctly

## Summary
The shares in `InsuranceFund.sol` are calculated differently during minting and burning which can lead to frontrunning and race-condition scenarios to extract as much value from the pool as possible.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user wants to mint shares for the insurance pool, they call `depositFor()` which mints them shares as:

`shares = amount * _totalSupply / _pool;`

where `_pool` = `_totalPoolValue();`

When burning the shares, they receive value based on:

`amount = balance() * shares / totalSupply();`

`_totalPoolValue()` returns the total value of supported collateral assets held by `InsuranceFund.sol`. `balance()` returns the insurance fund's VUSD balance. Simply, these values will not line up all of the time, especially during an auction.

During an auction, users can purchase an asset from the contract in exchange for VUSD. Take the following example:

- balance() = 1000 VUSD
- _totalPoolValue() = 500 DAI

Burning a share provides double the amount of VUSD as it costs to mint a share. Moreover, someone can monitor the mempool for calls to `MarginAccount.settleBadDebt()` which transfer assets into the insurance fund and start an auction. The moment that the asset is transferred in, the price to mint a share increases, so malicious actors are incentivized to front-run the call.

The attacker would then purchase all of the asset via `buyCollateralFromAuction()` which requires transferring in VUSD, subsequently increasing the amount of VUSD received upon burning their shares. This manipulation undermines the purpose of the insurance fund.

## Impact
- Gaming the share calculation to extract value from the insurance pool

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It seems like the minting calculation should also use `balance()` but I do not have enough information to provide further suggestion.
