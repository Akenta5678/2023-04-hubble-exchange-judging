# lack of slippage protection in `_liquidateFlexible`

## Summary

[_liquidateFlexible ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L424C14-L424C32)is not providing the slippage protection.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function _liquidateFlexible(address trader, uint maxRepay, uint idx) internal whenNotPaused returns(uint /* repayed */) {
        LiquidationBuffer memory buffer = _getLiquidationInfo(trader, idx);


        // Q. Can user's margin cover the entire debt?
        uint repay = _seizeToRepay(buffer, margin[idx][trader].toUint256());


        // A.1 Yes, it can cover the entire debt. Settle repayAble
        if (repay >= buffer.repayAble) {
            _liquidateExactRepay(
                buffer,
                trader,
                buffer.repayAble, // exact repay amount
                idx,
                0 // minSeizeAmount=0 implies accept whatever the oracle price is  -------->>> code sets the slippage value as zero
            );
            return buffer.repayAble; // repayed exactly repayAble and 0 is left to repay now
        }

## Impact

lack of slippage would hurt the user during the market fluctuation

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L424C14-L440

this will be called from the function `liquidateFlexible`. when the other liquidation based function has this slippage protection but this one does not.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add slippage protection.
