# Incorrect accounting in Insurance fund

## Summary

Incorrect accounting in `InsuranceFund.sol` contract can lead to easy loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract `InsuranceFund.sol` stores user tokens in case of protocol insolvency. This contract however is susceptible to attacks via external transfers due to a bug in the code. This is **different** from the typical inflation attack scenario, which only happens if the contract is empty.

When a user is depositing some funds, the shares minted are calculated using the following expression:

```solidity
if (_pool == 0) {
    shares = amount;
} else {
    shares = amount * _totalSupply / _pool;
}
```

So for a normal user, the protocol will use the `else` statement logic if funds are already in the contract from other users. Here `_pool` is calculated with the following logic.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L303-L315

Thus the `_pool` value is not the total VUSD holdings. In fact, it is the **total** holdings of **all** tokens in the collateral array. Let's assume other than VUSD, ETH is also a valid collateral, and sending ETH to the contract also increases the `_pool` value.

During withdrawals, however, the logic is slightly different.

```solidity
amount = balance() * shares / totalSupply();
```

Here `balance()` is the VUSD balance of the contract.

Lets assume the totalSupply is `TS`. The user deposits `A` no of tokens, netting them $A * TS / pool$ shares. Let's call that `s`. During withdrawal, the user gets `s * balance() / TS` tokens, where balance and TS have been updated due to the deposit of VUSD and mint. Thus for a mint and immediate withdrawal, the user payout is expected to be `A`. However, it actually is:

$$(A*TS/pool) * balance / TS_n$$

$$=(A*TS/pool) * balance / (TS + A*TS/pool)$$

$$=A*TS*balance / (pool*TS + A*TS)$$

$$=A*balance/(pool + A)$$

Thus only if `balance` = `pool + A`, the user would get back their initial deposit. But `balance` **only** counts VUSD tokens, while `pool` counts **all** collateral tokens. If both counted only vusd tokens, then the balance would have been pool + A, but this is not the case here. Thus if there is any external deposit of ETH, such that `balance != pool+A`, then the depositor will lose funds, since `pool` is the larger value and is in the denominator.

Example:

A = 10e6
balance = 100e6 VUSD tokens in the contract
pool = 100e6 VUSD tokens + 100e6 usd worth of ETH in contract form external transfers, and ETH is a valid collateral.

Then the user gets only 5e6 tokens back, losing half their investment.

## Impact

Users can lose funds due to the collateral being valued the same.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculation of `balance` and `_pool` should be done on the same tokens. Both should be done on VUDS only.
