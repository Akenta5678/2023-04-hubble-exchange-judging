# Malicious user can force caller to pay very high gas with long revert data

## Summary

The report highlights a vulnerability in the `VUSD.sol` contract related to the `processWithdrawals` function. The issue stems from emitting the returned data when a withdrawal fails, which can lead to a griefing attack. The vulnerability allows an attacker to revert a transaction with a large error message, forcing the caller of the `processWithdrawals` function to pay a significantly high gas fee or causing the function to be blocked.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerable section of code is as follows:

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory data) = withdrawal.usr.call{value: withdrawal.amount}("");
if (success) {
    reserve -= withdrawal.amount;
} else {
    emit WithdrawalFailed(withdrawal.usr, withdrawal.amount, data);
}
```

The issue arises from the fact that the `withdrawal.usr` address is controlled by the user and can be a smart contract. By reverting the transaction with a large error message in the receiver's fallback function, the user can cause the `WithdrawalFailed` event to emit data of unbounded length. This can lead to a denial-of-service scenario, where the caller of the `processWithdrawals` function is either blocked or forced to pay an exorbitant gas fee.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that functions dependent on the `processWithdrawals` function, such as the `removeMarginInUSD` function mentioned in the report, can be blocked or incur high gas fees. This can disrupt normal contract operations and lead to financial losses or delays in processing withdrawals.

## Proof of Concept (POC)

## Tool Used

The vulnerability was identified through a manual review.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended not to emit the returned data in the `WithdrawalFailed` event. By avoiding the emission of unbounded data, griefing attacks can be prevented.
