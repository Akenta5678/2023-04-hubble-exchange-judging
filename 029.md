# Impossible Liquidation if Oracle returned 0 answer

## Summary

Liquidation will revert if Oracle returned a zero price

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink has taken oracles offline in extreme cases. In such a situation (or one in which the token's value falls to zero), all liquidations for users holding the frozen asset would revert. This is because `_getLiquidationInfo()` calls `oracle.getUnderlyingPrice` and if `answer` is zero, liquidation will revert.

```solidity
34: require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
```

 `_getLiquidationInfo` is used as a helper function to get information about the liquidation status and is used when liquidation has to be done.

## Impact

Positions won't be liquidatable, at an extremely critical moment when they should be liquidatable
