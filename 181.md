# Burnt shares as a result of transferring shares to zero address (address(0))

## Summary
The _beforeTokenTransfer function does not check for the zero address when transferring shares.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability resides in the fact that this _beforeTokenTransfer does not check for the zero address (address(0)) when transferring shares. The zero address represents an invalid Ethereum address and is often used to indicate missing or nonexistent addresses.
Without the zero address check, it becomes possible to transfer shares to the zero address, which should not be allowed.
## Impact
Transferring shares to the zero address means that the shares will effectively be burned and become irretrievable. This will lead to a loss of funds for the token holders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the _beforeTokenTransfer function to include a check for the zero address. With this modification, the _beforeTokenTransfer function will now check if the to and from address is the zero address before allowing the transfer of shares. If the to and from address is the zero address, it will revert the transaction with an error message indicating that transferring shares to or from the zero address is not allowed
