# Position cannot be liquidated because the status does not set buffer.status to IS_LIQUIDATABLE

## Summary

The report identifies a vulnerability in the `MarginAccount` contract that prevents the liquidation of positions because the status is not set to `IS_LIQUIDATABLE`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `MarginAccount` contract, the ability to liquidate a position is contingent on the `buffer.status` being set to `IS_LIQUIDATABLE`. However, the code that sets `buffer.status` to `IS_LIQUIDATABLE` is commented out:

```solidity
(int256 weighted, int256 spot) = weightedAndSpotCollateral(trader);
if (weighted >= 0) {
    return (IMarginAccount.LiquidationStatus.ABOVE_THRESHOLD, 0, 0);
}

// _isLiquidatable = IMarginAccount.LiquidationStatus.IS_LIQUIDATABLE;
repayAmount = (-vusdBal).toUint256();
incentivePerDollar = PRECISION; // get atleast $1 worth of collateral for every $1 paid
```

As a result, the `buffer.status` is never set to `IS_LIQUIDATABLE`.

## Impact

The vulnerability prevents the liquidation of positions that are not sufficiently collateralized. Without the `buffer.status` being set correctly, the liquidation process cannot be initiated, potentially leading to an imbalance in the system and affecting the overall stability of the platform.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerable code snippet can be found [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/1f9a5ed0ca8f6004bbb7b099ecbb8ae796557849/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L284).

## Tool Used

The vulnerability was identified through a manual review.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to uncomment the code responsible for setting `buffer.status` to `IS_LIQUIDATABLE`. By uncommenting the code, the liquidation functionality will be enabled, allowing positions that are not sufficiently collaterized to be properly liquidated.
