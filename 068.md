# `getUnderlyingPrice` from `Oracle.sol` doesn't have extra checks which can return stale or incorrect results

## Summary
`getUnderlyingPrice` is getting the price from Chainlink oracle `latestRoundData` but it doesn't have any checks to see if the return data is stale or fresh which can have bad consequences to all of the functions that are using `getUnderlyingPrice`.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Oracle.sol` file the project is using `latestRoundData` in the `getUnderlyingPrice` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/Oracle.sol#L33-L36 function which is used in multiple scenarios like `MarginAccount.sol`, `InsuranceFund.sol`, `CleaningHouse.sol` , `OrderBook.sol` and `AMM.sol` but there is no check to see if the return data is stale or not, which could lead to stale prices or incorrect results as stated by the Chainlink docs.

## Impact
This could her all the calculations that are done by this function used in multiple contracts

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add all the checks necessary to see if the prices are fresh and correct similar to this 
```solidity
 function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
        virtual
        external
        view
        returns(int256 answer)
    {
        if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
            return stablePrice[underlying];
        }
        (uint80 roundID,answer, ,uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "");
        require(timestamp != 0, "");
        require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
        answer /= 100;
    }
```
