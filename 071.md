# Collateral assets are stuck in Insurance Fund if not purchased during auction

## Summary
When an auction for seized collateral is started, the collateral assets up for sale are owned by the insurance fund. When an auction finishes and any of the assets up for sale are not purchased, they are stuck in the insurance fund until the next auction is started, which can only occur when another trader suffers a position of bad debt.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a trader has bad debt, their bad debt can be settled by calling `settleBadDebt`. For every collateral asset that is seized from the trader, an auction is started in the insurance fund (`startAuction`):

```solidity
function startAuction(address token) override external onlyMarginAccount {
        if(!_isAuctionOngoing(auctions[token].startedAt, auctions[token].expiryTime)) {
            uint currentPrice = uint(oracle.getUnderlyingPrice(token));
            uint currentTimestamp = _blockTimestamp();
            auctions[token] = Auction(
                currentPrice * startPriceMultiplier / PRECISION,
                currentTimestamp,
                currentTimestamp + auctionDuration
            );
        }
    }
```

An interesting point to note here is that an auction can only be started by the margin account contract, and the only place in the margin account contract where an auction is started is in calls to `settleBadDebt`, where the collateral asset is actually transferred to the insurance fund:

```solidity
assets[i].token.safeTransfer(address(insuranceFund), amount.toUint256());
```

Currently the auction duration is set to 2 hours in the initialiser, and there is no admin/governance method to modify the auction duration. Therefore, there now exists a scenario by which a trader's bad debt is settled for a large amount of collateral and that collateral asset goes unsold in the auction. Now, if there are no other traders with bad debt, that collateral perpetually sits in the insurance fund and cannot be utilised or moved until `settleBadDebt` can be called for another trader with the same collateral asset and an auction started again. 

## Impact
Collateral assets that have been seized from a trader with bad debt can sit unused and unredeemable in the insurance pool for an indeterminate amount of time if not sold during the initial auction.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either the `onlyMarginAccount` modifier should be removed from `startAuction` to allow anyone to start an auction, or there should be another method in `MarginAccount.sol` that allows governance to start an auction (calls `startAuction` under the hood) without having to settle the bad debt of a trader.
