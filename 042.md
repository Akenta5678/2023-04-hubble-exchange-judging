# The withdrawTo function lacks a check for the address to

## Summary
The `withdrawTo` function in `VUSD.sol` doesn't check the input address `to` is zero, this may result in permanent loss of user funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdrawTo` function will push the infomation into `withdrawals` and the `processWithdrawals` can withdraw all funds:
```solidity
VUSD.sol
    /**
    * @notice Burn vusd from msg.sender and Q the withdrawal to `to`
    * @dev no need to add onlyMarginAccountHelper modifier as vusd is burned from caller and sent to specified address
    */
    function withdrawTo(address to, uint amount) external override whenNotPaused {
        _withdrawTo(to, amount);
    }

    function _withdrawTo(address to, uint amount) internal {
        require(amount >= 5 * (10 ** PRECISION), "min withdraw is 5 vusd");
        burn(amount); // burn vusd from msg.sender
        withdrawals.push(Withdrawal(to, amount * SCALING_FACTOR));
    }

    /**
     * @notice Process withdrawals in the queue. Sends gas token to the user.
    */
    function processWithdrawals() external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        uint reserve = address(this).balance;
        require(reserve >= withdrawals[start].amount, 'Cannot process withdrawals at this time: Not enough balance');
        uint i = start;
        while (i < withdrawals.length && (i - start) < maxWithdrawalProcesses) {
            Withdrawal memory withdrawal = withdrawals[i];
            if (reserve < withdrawal.amount) {
                break;
            }

            (bool success, bytes memory data) = withdrawal.usr.call{value: withdrawal.amount}("");
            if (success) {
                reserve -= withdrawal.amount;
            } else {
                emit WithdrawalFailed(withdrawal.usr, withdrawal.amount, data);
            }
            i += 1;
        }
        // re-entracy not possible, hence can update `start` at the end
        start = i;
    }
```
But there is not check to address `to`, if the address `to` equals to zero, then the user will permanently lose his funds.

## Impact
User will permanently lose his funds

## Recommendation
Add address check:

```solidity
VUSD.sol
    /**
    * @notice Burn vusd from msg.sender and Q the withdrawal to `to`
    * @dev no need to add onlyMarginAccountHelper modifier as vusd is burned from caller and sent to specified address
    */
    function withdrawTo(address to, uint amount) external override whenNotPaused {
        require(address(to) != address(0),"the address to is zero!");        
        _withdrawTo(to, amount);
    }
```
