# Possible to drain all vusd from InsureanceFund if user is the only staker

## Summary
Due to the calculation of withdrawal, it's possible to drain the contract from vusd if any are stored
## Vulnerability Detail
It's the classic case where someone deposits x amount, withdraws all except 1 wei which leverages the pool (LP) and then drains the pool.

Assume user deposits x amount, requests withdrawal and block.timestamp = unbondTime.
`_withdrawFor` will calculate the amount of vusd to withdraw by:

When we withdraw x -1 amount and the user is the only one currently invested in the fund, we end up with totalSupply and shares of 1.
Calculation of amount to withdraw will be `(vusdBalance * 1) / 1` = vusdBalance.
Meaning whatever amount of vusd is in the pool, that amount will be withdrawn
## Impact
whatever amount of vusd is in the pool can be withdrawn

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do note that this assumes the following: user deposited and awaited unbonTime to withdraw amount - 1 while no one else has deposited (e.g. without the user ts would be 0).

This would simply be avoided by initial minting an x amount
