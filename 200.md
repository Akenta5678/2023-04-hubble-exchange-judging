# Incorrect use of try/catch can allow calls that are meant to be reverted to not revert

## Summary
Severe inline documentation seems to assume that the entire call will revert when a try/catch fails. However, because the implementation only catches string errors, errors that stem from other kinds of error will not be caught, and hence not revert. When 2 `try` statements are used, it is possible that there is partial update of state, where the first `try` call succeeds and updates state, but the 2nd fails and only revert on the second `try`.

## Vulnerability Detail
An example of when this is a significant issue can be seen in `openComplementaryPositions`. 

```solidity
    function openComplementaryPositions(
        Instruction[2] calldata orders,
        int256 fillAmount,
        uint fulfillPrice
    )   external
        onlyOrderBook
        returns (uint256 openInterest)
    {

        try this.openPosition(orders[0], fillAmount, fulfillPrice, false) {
            // only executed if the above doesn't revert
            try this.openPosition(orders[1], -fillAmount, fulfillPrice, true) returns(uint256 _openInterest) {
                openInterest = _openInterest;
                // only executed if the above doesn't revert
            } catch Error(string memory reason) {
                // will revert all state changes including those made in this.openPosition(orders[0])
                revert(string(abi.encode(orders[1].orderHash, reason)));
            }
        } catch Error(string memory reason) {
            // surface up the error to the calling contract
            revert(string(abi.encode(orders[0].orderHash, reason)));
        }
    }
```

2 `try` statements are used. If the first `openPosition` succeeds, the second one will be called. Now, due to how error is caught and revert only if the error is a string error, all other kinds of error will cause a revert but instead continue. This means that in the complementary position, only the first position is opened successfully, but second one fails yet it does not cause an overall revert.

## Impact
An unbalanced position where only one side of the complement is opened causes significant problem for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Other kinds of errors should also be taken into consideration such as integer overflow/underflow.
