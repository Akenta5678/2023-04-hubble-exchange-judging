# OrderBook.sol#_cancelOrder() - validator cannot cancel order as intended by the protocol

## Summary
The function _cancelOrder() of the OrderBook contract is meant to be called upon wishing to cancel an order by a user and by a validator upon insufficient ( -ve ) margin of the trader, but this second scenario doesn't work as intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
In order to place an order, there is a check made in the internally called function ``_placeOrder(Order memory order, int size)`` to make sure that the msg.sender is the creator of the order (the trader):
``require(msg.sender == order.trader, "OB_sender_is_not_trader");``
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/orderbooks/OrderBook.sol#L120-L154

This statement leads to the fact that the check made inside the external ``cancelOrder()`` (which calls the interal ``_cancelOrder``) is making sure the order to be cancelled is being cancelled by it's creator:
``require(orders[i].trader == trader, "OB_trader_mismatch");`` <= ``orders[i].trader`` is the msg.sender of the above function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/orderbooks/OrderBook.sol#L172-L182

This sequence means that when we enter the function ``_cancelOrder()`` the msg.sender will definitely be the trader himself, rendering the if statement `` if (msg.sender != trader)`` always false, thus the validator can never cancel orders for someone else.

## Impact
Validators would not be able to delete orders with negative margin, leading to errors if they reach the matching phase. Protocol's intended behavior is impaired.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since there is already an existing ``onlyValidator`` modifier, consider creating a special function for validators, meant to cancel orders and transfer the require statement for the margin to be negative there, along with the logic.
