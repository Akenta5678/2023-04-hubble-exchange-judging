# Traders can charge fees without having enough balance to cover the fees

## Summary
In the _chargeFeeAndRealizePnL function, there is no explicit check to ensure that the trader has enough VUSD balance to cover the fees before charging the fees and realizing the profit/loss. The function calculates the fees to be charged and updates the feeSink address accordingly, but it does not perform a balance check on the trader's VUSD balance.
## Vulnerability Detail
This can lead to a vulnerability where the trader can perform trades or liquidations without having enough funds to pay the fees
## Impact
The fees may go unpaid, and the trader can potentially exploit this to avoid paying fees and incur losses without deducting them from their account balance. A malicious trader can manipulate their balance or gain an unfair advantage by trading with insufficient VUSD balance and profiting from the funding payment settlement.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check at the beginning of the function to verify the trader's balance. This can be done by calling the balanceOf function on the VUSD contract and comparing it to the calculated fee amount. If the balance is not sufficient, you can revert the transaction or handle the error accordingly.
