# Cancelling Orders After Partial Execution in executeMatchedOrders() Function

## Summary

The `cancelOrder` function can still work after the `executeMatchedOrders` function in the `OrderBook.sol` contract. This issue arises because the order status doesn't change in some situations. The `executeMatchedOrders` function is designed to execute matched orders but fails to properly update the order status and handle cancellations.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `executeMatchedOrders` function, the `_updateOrder` function is called to update the order status. However, if the order is not fully matched, the order status remains unchanged, leading to an opened position. During this time, users can still cancel the order, which sets the order status to "canceled". This issue occurs because other functions in the `OrderBook` contract, such as `liquidateAndExecuteOrder` and `executeMatchedOrders`, also check the order status. As a result, the order gets stuck and cannot proceed further.

## Impact

The impact of this bug is that users can cancel orders even after they have been partially executed through the `executeMatchedOrders` function. This can lead to inconsistencies in the order status and potentially result in incorrect positions and trading behavior.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/orderbooks/OrderBook.sol#L196

The issue can be observed in the following code snippet:

```solidity
function executeMatchedOrders() {
    try clearingHouse.openComplementaryPositions(orders, matchInfo, fillAmount, fillPrice) returns (uint256 openInterestNotional) {
        _updateOrder(orders[0], matchInfo[0].orderHash, fillAmount);
        _updateOrder(orders[1], matchInfo[1].orderHash, -fillAmount);
        // ...
    }
}

function _updateOrder() {
    // ...
    if (order.reduceOnly) {
        reduceOnlyAmount[order.trader][order.ammIndex] -= abs(fillAmount);
        //@audit: could bypass
        if (orderInfo[orderHash].filledAmount == order.baseAssetQuantity) {
            orderInfo[orderHash].status = OrderStatus.Filled;
            _deleteOrderInfo(orderHash);
        }
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, we recommend updating the `executeMatchedOrders` function and the `_updateOrder` function in the following way:

1. In the `executeMatchedOrders` function, after executing the matched orders, ensure that the order status is properly updated to reflect the partial execution.

2. In the `_updateOrder` function, if the order is not fully matched, consider updating the order status accordingly. This will prevent the order from getting stuck and allow it to proceed or be canceled correctly.

By making these modifications, you can ensure that the order status is accurately reflected, preventing inconsistencies and unexpected behavior in the trading system.
