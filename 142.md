# Assets sent from MarginAccount to InsuranceFund will be locked forever

## Summary
Assets sent from MarginAccount to InsuranceFund will be locked forever

## Vulnerability Detail
In MarginAccount.sol, 

```Solidity

382    function settleBadDebt(address trader) external whenNotPaused {
383        (uint256 notionalPosition,) = clearingHouse.getTotalNotionalPositionAndUnrealizedPnl(trader, 0, IClearingHouse.Mode.Min_Allowable_Margin); // last two arguments are irrelevent as we are checking only for zero/non-zero notional position in next step
384        require(notionalPosition == 0, "Liquidate positions before settling bad debt");

        // some code

403        for (uint i = 1 /* skip vusd */; i < assets.length; i++) {
404            int amount = margin[i][trader];
405            if (amount > 0) {
406                margin[i][trader] = 0;
407                assets[i].token.safeTransfer(address(insuranceFund), amount.toUint256());
408                seized[i] = amount.toUint256();
409                insuranceFund.startAuction(address(assets[i].token));
410            }
```
At L-407, the token is transferred to insuranceFund address. The collateral assets will be seized and transferred to the insuranceFund contract. However, there is no way for the liquidity providers of the insuranceFund to get back the collateral assets.

In the current implementation, these collateral assets seized during settleBadDebt() will be frozen in the contract, in essence. They belong to the liquidity providers and they should be able to retrieve them.

But the insurance fund doesn't have a way to transfer non-vusd out of the contract. Assets transferred to the InsuranceFund will be locked forever.

## Impact
