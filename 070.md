# No check for stale oracle prices

## Summary
When the price of an asset is fetched from Chainlink there is no check for the freshness of the price. This can result in a situation where the price being used by Hubble for an asset is stale.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `getUnderlyingPrice` method in `Oracle.sol` the following logic is used:

```solidity
        (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
        require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
        answer /= 100;
```

As you can see, there is no check as to the timestamp of this latest round returned by Chainlink. It is possible that the latest round could actually be from a long time ago when the price of the asset was significantly different to what it should actually be now.

## Impact
Stale prices for assets can result in trader obtaining a better/worse than expected price for an asset.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The timestamp of the latest price from Chainlink should be checked and validated that it has been updated within a given threshold period.
