# No check for stale oracle prices can impact funding rate and fill prices

## Summary
When the price of an asset is fetched from Chainlink there is no check for the freshness of the price. This can result in a situation where the price being used by Hubble for a perpetual is stale.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `getUnderlyingPrice` method in `Oracle.sol` the following logic is used:

```solidity
        (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
        require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
        answer /= 100;
```

As you can see, there is no check as to the timestamp of this latest round returned by Chainlink. It is possible that the latest round could actually be from a long time ago when the price of the asset was significantly different to what it should actually be now.

The price of the asset in Chainlink is particularly important is 2 circumstances. Firstly, when an order is executed the fill price is validated against the oracle price:

```solidity
        uint256 oraclePrice = amm.getUnderlyingPrice();

        uint bound = oraclePrice * (1e6 + spreadLimit) / 1e6;
        require(price <= bound, "AMM.price_GT_bound");
        // if spreadLimit >= 1e6 it means that 100% variation is allowed which means shorts at $0 will also pass.
        // so we don't need to check for that case
        if (spreadLimit < 1e6) {
            bound = oraclePrice * (1e6 - spreadLimit) / 1e6;
            require(price >= bound, "AMM.price_LT_bound");
        }
```

This could result in orders being executed at a stale price where the fill price is actually outside the spread limit of the actual (non-stale) price of the asset.

The oracle price is also very important when updating the funding rate for the perpetual:

```solidity
underlyingPrice = getUnderlyingTwapPrice(spotPriceTwapInterval);

        if (markPriceTwapData.lastTimestamp != 0) { // there was atleast 1 trade in the lifetime of the market
            int256 premium = getMarkPriceTwap() - underlyingPrice;
```

In this case the twap price of the underlying asset is used, so this is only a major problem when the oracle price remains stale for a substantial period of time.

## Impact
Stale prices for assets can result in trader obtaining a better/worse (depending on the side of the order) than expected price for a perpetual that is outside the normal allowed spread of the real asset price.

Prolonged stale price periods can also impact the funding rate of a given perpetual (either positively or negatively depending on the price movement against the perpetual against the underlying stale twap.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The timestamp of the latest price from Chainlink should be checked and validated that it has been updated within a given threshold period.
