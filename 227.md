# [MEDIUM] Oracle#getUnderlyingPrice - ChainLinkAdapterOracle will return the wrong price for asset if underlying aggregator hits minAnswer

## Summary
Chainlink Oracles have a built-in circuit breaker in case prices go outside predetermined minPrice and maxPrice price bands. Therefore, if an asset suffers a huge loss in value, such as the LUNA crash, the chainlink oracle will return the wrong prices, and the protocol can go into debt. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Oracle.sol `contract uses a chainlink aggregator oracle to get the latest price for setting the index price in the protocol. However, if an asset listed on the exchange suffers a huge change in value, like that of the LUNA crash, the Chainlink oracle will return the wrong prices. The protocol will keep getting the set `minPrice` or `maxPrice` as the answer, while the real price might differ.  Since the index price will be set wrong because of this, the funding rates will be wrong and users will suffer losses. 

The referred code snippet where prices are fetched is as follows:
```solidity
function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
        virtual
        external
        view
        returns(int256 answer)
    {
        if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
            return stablePrice[underlying];
        }
        (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
        require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
        answer /= 100;
    }
```

## Impact
The Oracle contract does not check if `minPrice` or `maxPrice` circuit breakers are hit by the chainlink aggregator. This might result in a loss for users of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if minPrice/maxPrice circuit breakers are hit, and apply appropriate procedures if they are hit.
