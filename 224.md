# [HIGH] Insurance Fund#depositFor - Insurance Funds can be manipulated and users can end up with 0 shares and permanent fund loss

## Summary
A malicious user can manipulate the insurance funds so that subsequent users get 0 shares even after transferring funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositFor()` function in InsuranceFund.sol decides on the number of shares that a depositor should have in the following way:

## Impact
```solidity
if (_pool == 0) {
shares = amount;
} 
else {
shares = amount * _totalSupply / _pool;
}
```
The value of `_pool` is determined by calling the` _totalPoolValue()` function, which iterates across all assets in the insurance fund pool and returns the sum of all assets. The `_totalPoolValue()` function determines the number of tokens of each asset in the following manner:

```solidity
for (uint i; i < assets.length; i++) {
uint _balance = IERC20(address(assets[i].token)).balanceOf(address(this));

if (_balance == 0) continue;
uint numerator = _balance * uint(oracle.getUnderlyingPrice(address(assets[i].token)));
uint denomDecimals = assets[i].decimals;
totalBalance += (numerator / 10 ** denomDecimals);
}
```
This opens up a vulnerability since it uses the `balanceOf() `function that the IERC20 interface provides.

When the first user ever to interact with the insurance fund contract is about to deposit an ERC20 token, the attacker can front-run the transaction and simply transfer a small amount of an asset that the insurance fund supports apart from VUSD. Since `depositFor() `is not called here, shares are not issued, but the `_pool` value will be positive. Therefore, this statement will execute:

```solidity
else {
shares = amount * _totalSupply / _pool;
}
```
Since `_totalSupply` is 0 and `_pool` is non-zero, the innocent user will get 0 shares, and subsequently, all users will start getting 0 shares.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is advised to keep track of assets deposited in the contract state itself so that ERC20 transfers which do not call the `depositFor()` function of the contract cannot manipulate the `_pool` value, or minimum liquidity must be added by the team and it must be added to the contract logic so that the teamâ€™s deposit is not front-run.
