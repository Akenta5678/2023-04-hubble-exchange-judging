# [MEDIUM] InsuranceFund#syncDeps - Governance can change vUSD address at any time and deposits can get lost

## Summary
The smart contract InsuranceFund.sol contains a potentially harmful function, `syncDeps()`, which allows for the contract address of vusd to be changed at any time by the Governance address. In some edge cases, this may cause users' funds to be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `syncDeps()` function can change the contract address of vusd without any restrictions. This change can interfere with the transactions of depositing and withdrawing vusd by users, possibly causing a loss of funds. If a new address is set for vusd between a user's deposit and withdraw transactions, the user could end up withdrawing a different vusd variant, such as VUSDv2, while having initially deposited VUSD.

## Impact
The users' funds are at risk of being lost due to this vulnerability. If the `syncDeps()` function is called and vusd is set to a new address in the middle of deposit and withdraw transactions, users could end up withdrawing nothing, hence suffering a fund loss.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L321
```solidity
function syncDeps(IRegistry _registry) public onlyGovernance {
    vusd = IERC20(_registry.vusd());
    marginAccount = _registry.marginAccount();
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A recommended solution is to consider making vusd unchangeable. However, if migration of vusd must be considered for future upgrades, you should change the `syncDeps()` function to ensure that the balance after the change is not less than the balance before the change. Here is a recommended change to the function:

```diff
function syncDeps(IRegistry _registry) public onlyGovernance {
+   uint _balance = balance();
    vusd = IERC20(_registry.vusd());
+   require(balance() >= _balance);
    marginAccount = _registry.marginAccount();
}
```

This will ensure that the balance of vusd does not decrease, preventing potential losses to the users' funds.
