# [MEDIUM] Oracle#getUnderlyingPrice - No stale price checks could lead to price manipulation by the user

## Summary
The smart contract Oracle.sol does not implement stale price checks by sanitizing the return values potentially leading to outdated and inaccurate oracle data. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getUnderlyingPrice()` function in the Oracle.sol contract fetches the price of an asset from the Chainlink Oracle but doesnâ€™t check if the price data is stale. This oversight could result in outdated and potentially inaccurate Oracle data if there are problems reaching consensus (e.g., Chainlink nodes abandon the Oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the Chainlink system). 

## Impact
Given the current market price, users could exploit this to execute transactions at stale prices, which can be exploited to borrow more assets than they should be able to.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/Oracle.sol#L24
```solidity
function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
    virtual
    external
    view
    returns(int256 answer)
{
    if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
        return stablePrice[underlying];
    }
    (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
    require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
    answer /= 100;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`getUnderlyingPrice()` should be updated to do additional checks to ensure the Oracle prices are not stale. The below variables should be returned and used: `roundId`, `timestamp`, and `answeredInRound`.

```diff

function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
    virtual
    external
    view
    returns(int256 answer)
{
    if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
        return stablePrice[underlying];
    }
- (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
+ (uint80 roundId, int256 answer,uint256 timestamp,, uint80 answeredInRound) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();+ require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price") 
+ require(timestamp != 0, "Round not complete")
   require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
   answer /= 100;
}

```
