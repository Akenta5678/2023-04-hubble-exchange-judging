# Single Auction Restriction could lead to user under bad debt

## Summary

Protocol includes a mechanism for conducting auctions following a bad debt settlement. However, it currently restricts auctions to only one per token at a time, and auctions have a relatively short duration of two hours.

## Vulnerability Detail
An auction is started when someone settle badDebt on `MarginAccount.sol` : `insuranceFund.startAuction(address(assets[i].token));` , the parameter is the collateral token to use for the auction to be started.
The InsuranceFund contract's `startAuction(address token)` function includes a check to ensure an auction is not already in progress for the same token. If an auction is ongoing `(_isAuctionOngoing(auctions[token].startedAt, auctions[token].expiryTime))`, a new auction will not be started.
```solidity
//E Only on auction per collateral token
if(!_isAuctionOngoing(auctions[token].startedAt, auctions[token].expiryTime)) {
    uint currentPrice = uint(oracle.getUnderlyingPrice(token));
    uint currentTimestamp = _blockTimestamp();
    auctions[token] = Auction(
        currentPrice * startPriceMultiplier / PRECISION,
        currentTimestamp,
        currentTimestamp + auctionDuration
    );
}
```

The contract also specifies a short auction duration (auctionDuration = 2 hours) but the way it is done it incentives users to buy it.

## Impact

The restriction of one auction per token at a time may delay the auctioning of seized collateral if multiple bad debts that include the same token are settled simultaneously. 
In bad conditions where there is a token price crash, multiples users could have bad debt being settle but with this single token restrictions this bad debt would not be settle which imply bigger bad debt for them and for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe implement some auctions per users on the mapping 
```solidity
//E token => Auction Struct
- mapping(address => Auction) public auctions;
//E token => userInDebt => Auction Struct
+ mapping(address => mapping(address => Auction)) public auctions;
```
