# Stable prices pose risk in times of volatility

## Summary

The project enables usage of stable prices for oracles. This poses a risk if the price turns out to be not so stable after all.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice` enables returning a stable price as oracle price:

```js
function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
    virtual
    external
    view
    returns(int256 answer)
{
    if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
        return stablePrice[underlying];
    }
```

This can and has caused issues in the past (for [reference](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=scream-lending-protocol-racks-up-35-million-in-bad-debt-after-hardcoding-not-so-stablecoin-prices-to-1)). Even though the price is not hardcoded here, a change is only possible through governance, which might not be flexible and fast enough to adjust to changing environments

## Impact

Price mismatch between oracle and market can cause bad behavior (e.g. reporting enough margin although there is not)
