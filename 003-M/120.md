# When a stablecoin is depegging will affect protocol operation

## Summary

The protocol allows the DAO to set the stablecoin price directly in oracle, the problem is that when the stablecoin depegged, the DAO's response is lagging, leaving a lot of arbitrage room for searchers.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
        virtual
        external
        view
        returns(int256 answer)
    {
        if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
            return stablePrice[underlying];
        }
        (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
        require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
        answer /= 100;
    }

    function setStablePrice(address underlying, int256 price) external onlyGovernance {
        requireNonEmptyAddress(underlying);
        require(price > 0, "stablePrice=0");
        stablePrice[underlying] = price;
    }
```
Here are two problems:
1. The response of DAO was lagging, and arbitrageurs had plenty of time to influence the protocol using the depegged stablecoins. Considering that the UST depegging, the price fell for two days in a row, the DAO may need to update the stablecoin price every second.
2. Once the stablecoin price is set, it cannot be cancelled because `setStablePrice` does not allow the price to be zero.

## Impact

When a stablecoin is depegging, there is a delay in price updates, which will affect protocol operation.
