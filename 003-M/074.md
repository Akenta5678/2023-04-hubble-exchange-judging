# Preset stable prices directly passes to protocol without checking with oracle price

## Summary
In Oracle.sol, some assets prices are not queried from an oracle, instead are preset and directly passed to the protocol without any verifications.
## Vulnerability Detail
In Oracle.sol, `getUnderlyingPrice()` there are some assets if their price is preset in `stablePrice` mapping, the stored price will be directly returned without further checking.
```solidity
//Oracle.sol - getUnderlyingPrice()
    function getUnderlyingPrice(
        address underlying
    ) external view virtual returns (int256 answer) {
        if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
            return stablePrice[underlying];
        }
...
```
These stored asset prices are set by governance in `setStablePrice()`, which means the price is not likely to be adjusted often enough if at all.
```solidity
    function setStablePrice(
        address underlying,
        int256 price
    ) external onlyGovernance {
        requireNonEmptyAddress(underlying);
```
## Impact
It's highly vulnerable to assume some assets price will not change because as we know stable coins and pegged assets can depeg. For example, usdc recently [depegged](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-and-why-do-stablecoins-depeg) following silicon valley bank collapse. When stable coin depegs, the collateral assets holding these coins are overvalued, positions can be over-leveraged, putting the protocol at risk.

## Recommendation
Avoid using stored stable prices. If preset prices must be used, check oracle price to ensure deviation is within accepted a boundary.
