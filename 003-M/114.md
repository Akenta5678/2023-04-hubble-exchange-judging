# Stable assets should not be hardpegged to 1

## Summary

The oracle has a `stablePrice` mapping that maps an underlying asset to some stable price. Such practices are highly discouraged because while the likelihood of either stablecoin (which is arguably the least volatile asset) de-pegging is low, it is not zero.

## Vulnerability Detail

There have been many instances of stablecoin losing their peg due to market conditions. For instance, with the recent market downturn in March 2023, compound was 3 cents away from having all its USDT swapped out for USDC because they hardcoded the value of USDC to 1.

## Impact

If the value of these assets deviates too much from their supposedly stable price, the entire protocol can be compromised. For instance, the spread may be validated wrongly, the liquidation info may be reported wrongly, the pnl retrieved may be calculated wrongly.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the use of this mapping entirely.
