# Collateral can be withdrawn with negative  VUSD balance

## Summary
In the removeMargin function of the MarginAccount contract, there is no check to ensure that the contract has sufficient VUSD balance before allowing the withdrawal of collateral. If the contract has insufficient VUSD balance, a loan is taken from the VUSD contract without explicitly checking if it can be repaid.
## Vulnerability Detail
The removeMargin function assumes that the withdrawal of collateral is valid based on the comparison balance >= amount.toInt256(). This condition only checks if the trader's margin balance is greater than or equal to the withdrawal amount, but it doesn't consider the overall VUSD balance of the contract or the ability to repay any potential loan taken from the VUSD contract.
Therefore, if the contract has insufficient VUSD balance or if a loan cannot be repaid, the function would still allow the withdrawal of collateral, potentially leading to an inconsistent state of the contract or a situation where the loan cannot be repaid.
## Impact
An attacker can withdraw collateral even if their VUSD balance is negative, effectively allowing them to take a loan from the VUSD contract. This will lead to an imbalance in the system and potential financial loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify by  checking if it has sufficient VUSD balance by comparing it with the withdrawal amount. If the balance is not enough, the function will revert with an error message.
Next, the function calculates the loan repayment amount using the _calculateLoanRepayment function (which you will need to implement). This function determines the amount needed to repay the loan taken from the VUSD contract. If the loan repayment amount plus the trader's VUSD balance is less than zero, indicating that the loan cannot be repaid, the function will revert.
Finally, if both checks pass, the contract will update the VUSD balances accordingly, deducting the withdrawn amount from the contract's balance and adding the loan repayment amount to the trader's balance. The collateral is then transferred to the trader using the _transferOutCollateral function (which you will also need to implement).
