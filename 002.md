# vUSD will be pegged to the native token of the chain deployed to (instead of the claimed USDC)

## Summary
vUSD will be pegged to the native token of the chain deployed to (instead of the claimed USDC stated in the comment) -- the deployment chain is stated to be possibly "any EVM chain".
```solidity
/**
 * @title VUSD is a wrapper over USDC (also the gas token). VUSD it the 0th collateral in the system and also the only coin accepted by the insurance fund.
 * @notice In Hubble Exchange docs/contracts etc, VUSD is interchangeably referred to as hUSD
*/
```

## Vulnerability Detail
The implementation logic in minting vUSD in equivalent amount (up to precision adjustment) to the msg.value. However, in all major EVM chains, the native tokens are not pegged to USD, which can lead to incorrect minting and undesirable behavior for the underlying value for vUSD token.

## Impact
vUSD token on each chain will not be pegged to USDC as claimed -> causing all accountings to be incorrect, and potentially leading to protocol insolvency.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Don't rely on msg.value when minting , and instead use `safeTransfer` in an equivalent amount of USDC to mint.
- Ensure deployment is only on chains where native token is pegged to USDC, e.g. Hubblenet.
