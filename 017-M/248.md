# Potential accounting problems due to issue in `ClearingHouse.updatePositions()`

## Summary

Potential issue in `ClearingHouse.updatePositions()` when lastFundingTime is not being updated by `ClearingHouse.settleFunding`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`ClearingHouse.lastFundingTime` is only updated, when `_nextFundingTime` is not zero:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L281-L282

`_nextFundingTime` is determined a few lines above by a call to `amms[i].settleFunding()`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L267

The return value of `amms[i].settleFunding()` can be zero for `_nextFundingTime`, if the `block.timestamp` is smaller than the next funding time:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/AMM.sol#L236-L249

That means that if the last market inside the `amms` array has not reached the next funding time at `block.timestamp`, `_nextFundingTime` will be zero and `lastFundingTime` will not be updated.

Then when `ClearingHouse.updatePositions()` is called, it will not process `fundingPayment` because `lastFundingTime` was not updated:

## Impact

Unrealized funding payments are not settled correctly, potentially leading to incorrect margin accounting when opening a position. Also `marginAccount.realizePnL()` (line 255 ClearingHouse.sol) won't get called, so the trader won't receive funds that they should receive.

Note: `ClearingHouse.updatePositions()` is called by `ClearingHouse._openPosition` (line 141 ClearingHouse.sol).

Note: `ClearingHouse.liquidate` -> `ClearingHouse.openPosition` -> `ClearingHouse._openPosition`

There can be multiple potential issues with accounting that can result due to this issue, both when liquidating and when opening a position.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adjusting the code inside `ClearingHouse.settleFunding()` to account for the case where the last market inside the `amms` array returns zero for `_nextFundingTime` when `Amm.settleFunding()` is called (line 267 ClearingHouse.sol). For example introduce a boolean variable that tracks whether a market inside `amms` array didn't return zero for `_nextFundingTime`.

```solidity
// ClearingHouse
// settleFunding
268            if (_nextFundingTime != 0) {
269                _marketReachedNextFundingTime = true; // <-- @audit new boolean to track

281        if (_marketReachedNextFundingTime) {
282            lastFundingTime = _blockTimestamp();
283        }
```
