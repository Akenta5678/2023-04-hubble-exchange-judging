# The scaling on `weighted` in MarginAccount.weightedAndSpotCollateral() doesn't consider that the decimals of supported collateral token could be 1e6

## Summary
scaling a collateral with 1e6 as decimal will give issues 

## Vulnerability Detail
The main issue here is that `denomDecimals` isn't checked in an `if` statement to ensure its not = 1e6 before scaling 

And also i'm not so sure if the scaling is that effective.
```solidity
 weighted += (numerator * _collateral.weight.toInt256() / int(10 ** (denomDecimals + 6)));
```
## Impact
precision loss error will happen for collateral tokens with 1e6 decimals

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check the collateral decimals in a `if` statement and only scale if its != 1e6
