# External calls issues can  cause traders to lose money

## Summary
- external calls  from the contract can be manipulated by an attacker case they can fail silently .
## Vulnerability Detail
- The contract makes external calls to other contracts as `clearingHouse.updatePositions(trader)` in the lines `#L323 and #L341 and #L359 and #L642` , `insuranceFund.seizeBadDebt(badDebt)` in the line `#L398` , `insuranceFund.startAuction(address(assets[i].token))` in the line `#L409`, and the `oracle.getUnderlyingPrice(address(coll.token)).toUint256()` in the line `#L496`.
These calls can fail silently or can  be manipulated by malicious contracts that can use by an attacker 
## Impact
- if  the `clearingHouse.updatePositions(trader)` call to fail, this prevent the liquidation process from proceeding.
- if the `insuranceFund.seizeBadDebt(badDebt)` call to fail, this  prevent the trader from repaying their debt and cand result in them losing their collateral.
- if the `insuranceFund.startAuction(address(assets[i].token))` call to start an auction at a very low price, can  result in the trader losing their collateral for a fraction of its value.
- if  the `oracle.getUnderlyingPrice(address(coll.token)).toUint256()` call to return an incorrect price, can result in the trader losing more money than they should.

## Recommendation
- check the return value of external calls and handle potential failures.
