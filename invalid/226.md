# [HIGH] InsuranceFund#depositFor - Insurance Fund share mispricing can result in depositors getting 0 shares and attacker stealing all the funds

## Summary
A malicious user with existing shares can front-run other deposit transactions so that other users get 0 shares, and the attacker can after that steal funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositFor()` function in `InsuranceFund.sol` decides on the number of shares that a depositor should have in the following way:

```solidity
if (_pool == 0) {

shares = amount;

} else {

shares = amount * _totalSupply / _pool;

}
```
The `_pool` value is determined by calling the `_totalPoolValue()` function, which iterates across all assets in the insurance fund pool and returns the sum of all assets. 

Since the initial number of shares is determined by simply equating shares = amount, the attacker can follow these steps to steal user funds: 

1. Make a deposit of a small amount, let us say 1 vUSD, by calling the `depositFor()` function. The attacker gets 1 share. Immediately call the unbond function as well. 

2. Observe multiple subsequent deposit transactions, and letâ€™s say the highest deposit transaction is of value x. However, the sum of values of this set of transactions must exceed x. 
3. The attacker transfers a vUSD value of `x+1` to the contract without calling the `depositFor()` function. This means that the total supply of shares minted is 1, but the pool value increases by `x+1` vUSD. 
4. The subsequent transactions, all less than the value of `x+1 `vUSD go through, and all of them get 0 shares since `shares = amount * (1 share) / (1+x+1 vUSD)`, and the amount is lesser than `x+2`. 
5. After the unbonding period, the attacker withdraws a surplus of vUSD.

## Impact
A malicious user can front-run the first insurance fund deposit and manipulate the insurance fund contract into issuing 0 shares for subsequent deposits and steal the insurance funds thereafter.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There are two possible steps: 

1. The team must add and burn a minimum liquidity value when deploying the contract and then only open it to the public. This must be set within the contract logic. Thus, such an attack becomes expensive. 

2. The asset balances can be tracked within the contract state itself so that share mispricing is avoided.
