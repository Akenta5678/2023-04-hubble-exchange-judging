# ClearingHouse.sol : contract does not have function to blacklist an AMM though it has function to whitelist.

## Summary

`ClearingHouse.sol`  has the [whitelistAmm](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L510C14-L510C26) which is used by the governance to whitelist a particular market.

But it does not have any counteraction function to revert the status in the event of misbehavior of the amm.

## Vulnerability Detail

Refer the summary section.

## Impact

If market misbehaves, it can not be controlled. This would lead to unexpected consequences.

## Recommendation

We suggest to add function to balcklist  in the event of either market failure or misbehave.
