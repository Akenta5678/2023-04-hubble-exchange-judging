# initialize() functions are front-runnable

## Summary

All `initialize()` function are front-runnable

## Vulnerability Detail

In almost all contracts there is an `initialize()` function lacking access control.
After a discussion with sponsor he told me that all contract are going to be deployed with 2 tx , 1 for deployment and another one for `initialize()`.
However it is still possible to front-run these call by sending a transaction with higher gas fees

## Impact

Initialize() function could be front-run which is critical regarding the rights and ownership these functions provide.
The biggest impact would be on `MarginAccount.sol` where `initialize()` can be front-run to add a malicious `address _vusd` and disrupt all the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a 2-way to first contruct the contract and create an ownership role that the `initialize()` function 
For example : 
```solidity
constructor(address _clearingHouse, address _marginAccount) {
        clearingHouse = IClearingHouse(_clearingHouse);
        marginAccount = IMarginAccount(_marginAccount);
+       initializerRole = msg.sender
    }

    function initialize(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _version,
        address _governance
    ) external initializer 
+      onlyInitializerRole 
    {
        __EIP712_init(_name, _version);
        _setGovernace(_governance);
    }
```
