# [MEDIUM] ClearingHouse#updatePositions - Unbounded AMM array might cause a denial of service

## Summary
The smart contract ClearingHouse has a function `updatePositions()` which could potentially cause a Denial of Service (DoS) if the `amms` array is unbounded and becomes too large.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `updatePositions() `function iterates over the `amms` array. If this array grows too large, the function could exceed the block gas limit, making it impossible to invoke this function. This scenario would effectively halt the operation of the contract, which could be considered as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

## Impact
A successful DoS attack would halt the operations of the contract, making it unusable. This could affect any traders using the contract, and potentially could lead to financial loss or interrupted service.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L247
```solidity
uint numAmms = amms.length;
            for (uint i; i < numAmms; ++i) {
                (int256 _fundingPayment, int256 cumulativePremiumFraction) = amms[i].updatePosition(trader);
                if (_fundingPayment != 0) {
                    fundingPayment += _fundingPayment;
                    emit FundingPaid(trader, i, _fundingPayment, cumulativePremiumFraction);
                }
            }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a mechanism to limit the size of the `amms` array. Alternatively, you could change the implementation to avoid iterating over the entire `amms` array within a single transaction. This could be done by processing a subset of the array at a time or using a pattern such as the 'pull over push' strategy for updating positions.
