# Possible Order Front-Running through `getUnderlyingPrice` and `getUnderlyingTwapPrice` functions in `Oracle.sol`

## Summary

While the `Oracle.sol` contract does not directly deal with limit orders or their execution, it provides critical price data that other contracts can use to manage such orders. Thus, vulnerabilities in `Oracle.sol` could indirectly impact order handling. In this context, a potential vulnerability exists where an attacker can manipulate the price data used by other contracts, potentially leading to situations such as order front-running.

## Vulnerability Detail

The potential vulnerability arises from the way the `getUnderlyingPrice` and `getUnderlyingTwapPrice` functions are structured. These functions return the price of a given underlying asset. The price returned is either a static price set by the contract's owner (the governance address) or fetched from an associated Chainlink price feed (if the static price is not set). 

Given the reliance on external data, there's a potential risk that a sophisticated attacker could manipulate the price feed. Moreover, since there's no verification of the data authenticity from the Chainlink Aggregator, the contract could potentially use incorrect price data.

```solidity
function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying) 
        virtual
        external
        view
        returns(int256 answer)
{
    if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
        return stablePrice[underlying];
    }
    (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
    require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
    answer /= 100;
}
```

If this happens, any smart contract relying on these Oracle functions for limit order handling could end up processing orders based on this inaccurate price data, leading to unfair trade executions. An attacker could front-run orders by manipulating the oracle data and cause orders to execute at a disadvantageous price.

## Impact

The impact is potentially high for any smart contract using these oracle price functions for limit order handling or any other critical operations. With manipulated prices, limit orders can execute at non-market prices, causing significant financial loss to users.

## Code Snippet

Here are the exact code snippets from `Oracle.sol` related to the discussed functions:

```solidity
function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
        virtual
        external
        view
        returns(int256 answer)
{
    if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
        return stablePrice[underlying];
    }
    (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
    require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
    answer /= 100;
}
```

```solidity
function getUnderlyingTwapPrice(address underlying, uint256 intervalInSeconds)
        virtual
        public
        view
        returns (int256)
{
    ...
    AggregatorV3Interface aggregator = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]);
    ...
    (uint80 round, uint256 latestPrice, uint256 latestTimestamp) = getLatestRoundData(aggregator);
    ...
    // The rest of the code for TWAP calculation
    ...
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

One recommended approach to minimize the vulnerability is to include additional safeguards when dealing with price feed data. Instead of trusting the data provided by Chainlink directly, use Chainlink's inbuilt decentralized data verification, where multiple price feeds are checked, and the median price is taken. This makes price manipulation significantly harder.

Moreover, consider adding mechanisms to detect abrupt or significant price changes that could be indicative of manipulation. This could be done by comparing

 the latest price with historical data, and if the deviation is above a certain threshold, halt operations until the situation is investigated.

## Proof Of Concept

Proof of Concept requires a controlled environment where one can manipulate a Chainlink node data, which isn't feasible in the Mainnet. Therefore, this vulnerability remains theoretical but is still a possibility given the right circumstances.
