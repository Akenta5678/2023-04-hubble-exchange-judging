# `Initialize` function does not have access control can allow anyone to set `governance` address

## Summary
- the contact cannot be `initialize` unless it is called from the `_governance` address, it's a special function and  can only be called once, and also takes a single parameter, which is the address of the governance address, if the  function is called from any other address  than the _governance address, the function will fail. This is because `the` initialize() function is only supposed to be called by the governance address 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `initialize` function does not have any access control modifiers so any address could call this function and set the governance address this is problem if the governance address is used for important administrative tasks, and the `initialize` calls ` `_setGovernace(_governance);` which will store the governance address.
```solidity
    function initialize(address _governance) external initializer {
        _setGovernace(_governance);
    }
```
## Impact
-  if an attacker exploit this in the contract can have  access control modifiers on the initialize() function, and call the function and set the governance address to an address that can control. this would allow him to steal funds from the contract, or even take control of the contract itself.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- add an access control modifier to the `initialize` function to ensure that only the contract `deployer` or another trusted address can set the governance address.
