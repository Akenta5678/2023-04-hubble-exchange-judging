# Malicious actor in AMM could use the information to front-run trades

## Summary
 You can use the getOpenNotionalWhileReducingPosition() function to calculate how much profit you will make if you reduce your position
 However, if the function is public, anyone can use it to calculate the open notional and realized PNL of your position. This information could be used by a malicious actor to front-run your trade.
## Vulnerability Detail
1.The malicious actor uses the getOpenNotionalWhileReducingPosition() function to calculate the open notional and realized PNL of your position.
2.The malicious actor then places a trade in the same asset as you, but in the opposite direction. For example, if you are reducing your position in an asset, the malicious actor would buy the asset.
3.The malicious actor then waits for your trade to be executed. Once your trade is executed, the malicious actor's trade will be executed immediately afterwards.
4.This allows the malicious actor to profit by taking advantage of the price difference between the two trades.
## Impact
Let's say you are reducing your position in an asset with a current price of $100. The malicious actor uses the getOpenNotionalWhileReducingPosition() function to calculate that you will make a profit of $10 if you reduce your position. The malicious actor then places a trade to buy the asset at $100. Once your trade is executed, the malicious actor's trade will be executed immediately afterwards. The malicious actor will then sell the asset for $110, making a profit of $10.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the risk of these attacks, the function getOpenNotionalWhileReducingPosition()
 could be made private. This would prevent anyone from calling the function without permission. However, this would also make the function less accessible to developers who need to use it.
If developers wish to keep the function public, they could introduce fees for using it. This would make it more expensive for malicious actors to use the function, and it would also discourage them from doing so.
