# The `MarginAccount.settleBadDebt()` function pulls the bad debt obligation from the `InsuranceFund` but the function doesn't pay issued credit

## Summary

The [settleBadDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L382) functions [pulls the debt obligation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L398) from the `InsuranceFund` but the `settleBadDebt()` function doesn't pay the issued credit.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [settleBadDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L382) function helps to settle the trader bad debt using [the insurance fund](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L398). So the `settleBadDebt()` do the next process:
1. Get the [trader bad debt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L384-L394).
2. The [InsuranceFund pays](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L398) the amount bad debt.
3. The trader collateral is [transferred and auctioned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L402-L411).

In the other side, the ClearingHouse contract can [issue a vusd credit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L158C31-L158C46) when there is not any [vUSD in the MarginAccount contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L633), so that credited `vusd` is backed by nothing.

The problem is that the `settleBadDebt()` function gets the trader bad debt from the `InsuranceFund` but it doesn't pay the credit debt issued by the `MarginAccount` contract. That could be a problem if the issued credit is very high causing a `vUSD` inflation.

## Impact

The issued credit must be paid as soon as there is `vUSD` in the `MarginAccount` contract so the `vusd` can be controlled by a possible inflation of credit (vUSD) that is not backed by anything. So the [settleBadDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L382) must paid the issued credit if exists.

## Code Snippet

The [settleBadDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L382) function:

```solidity
    function settleBadDebt(address trader) external whenNotPaused {
        (uint256 notionalPosition,) = clearingHouse.getTotalNotionalPositionAndUnrealizedPnl(trader, 0, IClearingHouse.Mode.Min_Allowable_Margin); // last two arguments are irrelevent as we are checking only for zero/non-zero notional position in next step
        require(notionalPosition == 0, "Liquidate positions before settling bad debt");

        // The spot value of their collateral minus their vUSD obligation is a negative value
        require(getSpotCollateralValue(trader) < 0, "Above bad debt threshold");

        int vusdBal = margin[VUSD_IDX][trader];

        // this check is not strictly required because getSpotCollateralValue(trader) < 0 is a stronger assertion
        require(vusdBal < 0, "Nothing to repay");

        uint badDebt = (-vusdBal).toUint256();
        Collateral[] memory assets = supportedCollateral;

        // This pulls the obligation
        insuranceFund.seizeBadDebt(badDebt);
        margin[VUSD_IDX][trader] = 0;

        // Insurance fund gets all the available collateral
        uint[] memory seized = new uint[](assets.length);
        for (uint i = 1 /* skip vusd */; i < assets.length; i++) {
            int amount = margin[i][trader];
            if (amount > 0) {
                margin[i][trader] = 0;
                assets[i].token.safeTransfer(address(insuranceFund), amount.toUint256());
                seized[i] = amount.toUint256();
                insuranceFund.startAuction(address(assets[i].token));
            }
        }
        emit SettledBadDebt(trader, seized, badDebt, _blockTimestamp());
    }
```

The [seizeBadDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L143) and [settlePendingObligation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L153) functions:

```solidity
File: InsuranceFund.sol
143:     function seizeBadDebt(uint amount) override external onlyMarginAccount {
144:         pendingObligation += amount;
145:         emit BadDebtAccumulated(amount, block.timestamp);
146:         settlePendingObligation();
147:     }
148: 
149:     /**
150:      * @notice Sometimes the insurance fund may be in deficit and there might not be enough vusd to settle the obligation.
151:      * Using this function obligation can be settled with future fees.
152:     */
153:     function settlePendingObligation() public {
154:         if (pendingObligation > 0) {
155:             uint toTransfer = Math.min(vusd.balanceOf(address(this)), pendingObligation);
156:             if (toTransfer > 0) {
157:                 pendingObligation -= toTransfer;
158:                 vusd.safeTransfer(marginAccount, toTransfer);
159:             }
160:         }
161:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

If `vUSD` is transferred to the `MarginAccount` contract while the `settleBadDebt()` is executed, it should paid the issued credit is exists.
