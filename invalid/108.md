# getPositionMetadata can potentially report the incorrect value for uPnl

## Summary

`getPositionMetadata` reports the incorrect values for `uPnl` if `price` or `size` is 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

`size` can be 0 if the user opens a long / short and opens an equal but opposite position. Funding is already added / subtracted from his uPnl.

`price` can also be 0 if the price reported by chainlink is less than 100 and it rounds to 0 because of the division by 100. For instance, if I were shorting terra, prices were to reach close to 0 e.g. $0.01, my uPnl is positive however if the price falls further to a value lower than $0.00001 (e.g. [terra’s ATL price is $0.000000999967](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-luna-classic)), my uPnl suddenly goes to 0.

As you can see from both scenarios, my uPnl is not 0 yet `getPositionMetadata` will return 0 for uPnl. 

## Impact

There are too many parts of the codebase that uses `getPositionMetadata` or uses a function that calls `getPositionMetadata` for example when calculating `realizedPnl` inside of `_reducePosition`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the code that explicitly handles when notionalPos == 0 and marginFraction can only be calculated if notionalPos is > 0.
```solidity
function getPositionMetadata(uint256 price, uint256 openNotional, int256 size, int256 margin)
    public
    pure
    returns (uint256 notionalPos, int256 uPnl, int256 marginFraction)
{
    notionalPos = price * abs(size).toUint256() / BASE_PRECISION_UINT;
    if (size > 0) {
        uPnl = notionalPos.toInt256() - openNotional.toInt256();
    } else if (size < 0) {
        uPnl = openNotional.toInt256() - notionalPos.toInt256();
    }
    if(notionalPos > 0) marginFraction = (margin + uPnl) * 1e6 / notionalPos.toInt256();
}
```
