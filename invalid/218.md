# Use `call` instead of `transfer`

## Summary

Contract `HGT.sol` uses `transfer` to send eth instead of `call`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract `HGT.sol` uses the function `transfer` to send eth to the receiver. This is a problem because the receiver contract allocates only 2300 gas for the call. This can lead to out-of-gas errors if the `receive` function in the target contract has any code that uses more than 2300 gas.

## Recommendation

Use `Address.call()` pattern to send gas tokens instead.
