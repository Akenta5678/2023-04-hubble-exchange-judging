# Lack of Fair Deposit Ratios

## Summary
The deposit amount calculation in the insurance fund determines the number of shares received by depositors based on the pool value and total supply of shares. However, when the pool value is low or the total supply is high, depositors may receive fewer shares for the same deposited funds. This can create the perception of a higher price per share, which may discourage some depositors from participating in the fund.
## Vulnerability Detail
Depositors may receive fewer shares for the same deposited funds.
This happens when the pool value is low or the total supply of shares is high.
It creates a perception of a higher price per share.
This can discourage some depositors from participating in the fund.

## Impact
May discourage potential depositors from participating in the insurance fund.

## Code Snippet


    /**
     * @notice deposit vusd to the insurance fund
     * @param amount amount to deposit
    */
    function deposit(uint amount) external {
        depositFor(_msgSender(), amount);
    }


    /**
     * @notice Deposit to the insurance fund on behalf of another address
     * @param to address to deposit for
    */
    function depositFor(address to, uint amount) override public {
        settlePendingObligation();
        // we want to protect new LPs, when the insurance fund is in deficit
        require(pendingObligation == 0, "IF.deposit.pending_obligations");


        uint _pool = _totalPoolValue();
        uint _totalSupply = totalSupply();
        uint vusdBalance = balance();
        if (_totalSupply == 0 && vusdBalance > 0) { // trading fee accumulated while there were no IF LPs
            vusd.safeTransfer(governance(), vusdBalance);
            _pool = 0;
        }


        vusd.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount);
        uint shares = 0;
        if (_pool == 0) {
            shares = amount;
        } else {
            shares = amount * _totalSupply / _pool;
        }
        _mint(to, shares);
        emit FundsAdded(to, amount, _blockTimestamp());
    }

## Recommendation
Implement a dynamic deposit calculation mechanism that takes into account the pool value and total supply of shares. This ensures that depositors receive a fair and consistent number of shares relative to their deposited funds.
