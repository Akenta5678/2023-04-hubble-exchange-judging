# _liquidateExactRepay is incompatible with collateral decimals less than 6

## Summary

`_liquidateExactRepay` is incompatible with collateral decimals less than 6, such as GUSD(2 decimals).

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function _liquidateExactRepay(
        LiquidationBuffer memory buffer,
        address trader,
        uint repay,
        uint idx,
        uint minSeizeAmount
    )
        internal
        returns (uint seized)
    {
        // determine the seizable collateral amount on the basis of the most recent chainlink price feed
        seized = _min(
            _scaleDecimals(repay * buffer.incentivePerDollar, buffer.decimals - 6) / buffer.priceCollateral,
            // can't seize more than available
            // this also protects the liquidator in the scenario that they were front-run and only a small seize isn't worth it for them
            margin[idx][trader].toUint256()
        );
        require(seized >= minSeizeAmount, "Not seizing enough");
        _executeLiquidation(trader, repay, idx, seized, buffer.repayAble);
    }
```

Here if decimals are less than 6 the liquidation will overflow and can't use this collateral to liquidate, but the protocol doesn't specify that. Everything else is working fine, here is the only problem. The user can add collateral (if the protocol supports), but it cannot be used for liquidation.

## Impact

decimals less than 6 cannot be used to liquidate collateral
