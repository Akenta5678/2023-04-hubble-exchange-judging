# Integer Division Precision Loss in HGT.sol's `_debitFrom` Function (Solidity >0.8.0)

## Summary

The `_debitFrom` function in the `HGT.sol` contract suffers from a precision loss issue due to integer division. When the `_amount` is divided by `SCALING_FACTOR`, the resulting value is not rounded, but floored (due to how Solidity handles integer division), leading to potential precision loss. This issue occurs every time `_debitFrom` is called.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `HGT.sol` contract's `_debitFrom` function, which is intended to debit the provided `_amount` from the `circulatingSupply`, divides the `_amount` by `SCALING_FACTOR` (1e12). However, the division operation on Solidity rounds down the result to the nearest integer, leading to a precision loss in cases where the `_amount` is not a multiple of `SCALING_FACTOR`. The following lines of code indicate this issue:

```solidity
function _debitFrom(address, uint _amount) internal virtual override returns(uint) {
    circulatingSupply -= _amount;
    _amount = _amount / SCALING_FACTOR;
    require(_amount > 1, "HGT: Insufficient amount"); // so that _amount != 0 in the next line
    _amount -= 1; // round down when withdrawing
    return _amount;
}
```

For instance, if `_amount` is 1500, which is not a multiple of `SCALING_FACTOR`, the division result would be 0 due to Solidity's integer division rounding down.

## Impact

This issue could lead to the `circulatingSupply` being debited more than the amount that gets actually returned to the users, creating a discrepancy between the total circulating supply and the actual amount that users have withdrawn. It could also lead to a situation where users could lose tokens in the process of withdrawal.

## Code Snippet

Here is the exact code snippet from `HGT.sol` where the issue lies:

```solidity
function _debitFrom(address, uint _amount) internal virtual override returns(uint) {
    circulatingSupply -= _amount;
    _amount = _amount / SCALING_FACTOR;
    require(_amount > 1, "HGT: Insufficient amount"); // so that _amount != 0 in the next line
    _amount -= 1; // round down when withdrawing
    return _amount;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To avoid precision loss, consider using a library for safe mathematical operations that handle decimal numbers or fixed-point numbers (like the OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library). This would allow for accurate division operations and prevent rounding down. 

## Proof Of Concept (Steps in order to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. Deploy the `HGT.sol` contract on a local development blockchain.
2. Initialize the contract with a test address as `_governance`.
3. Call `_debitFrom` with a test address and an `_amount` that's not a multiple of `SCALING_FACTOR`.
4. The returned `_amount` will be less than expected due to rounding down of the division operation.
5. Repeat the steps with multiple `_amount` values to observe the discrepancy due to precision loss.
