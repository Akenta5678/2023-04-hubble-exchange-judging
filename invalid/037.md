# `settleFunding()` Function Has the Potential to Exceed the Block

## Summary

the `settleFunding()` function  exceed the block gas limit on Avalanche this happen because the function iteratively loops through each market, with each iteration entering an unbounded while loop in `_calcTwap.` The more active the markets are, the more gas intensive `_calcTwap` becomes, as more snapshots need to be traversed. so the  combination of more active markets and an increase in available markets make it very likely that some users will be unable to call `settleFunding` in the long run.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `settleFunding()` function iteratively loops through each market, with each iteration entering an unbounded while loop in `_calcTwap.` so the  more active the markets are, the more gas intensive `_calcTwap` becomes, as more snapshots need to be traversed.
 and the combination of more active markets and an increase in available markets make it very likely that some users will be unable to call `settleFunding` in the long run.
## Impact
- if someone exploit this is going to lead users to lose revenue if he is unable to call `settleFunding.`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- limiting the number of markets that are processed by the function in each block, caching the results of previous calls to the _calcTwap function, or using a different algorithm to calculate the TWAP.
