# The `InsuranceFund.buyCollateralFromAuction()` doesn't pay the `InsuranceFund` pending obligations

## Summary

The [InsuranceFund.buyCollateralFromAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L184C14-L184C38) function sells the auctioned collateral but it doesn't pay the `InsuranceFund` [pending obligations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L153) causing there to be outstanding obligations in the `MarginAccount` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [InsuranceFund.buyCollateralFromAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L184C14-L184C38) function helps to sell the auctioned collateral executed by the [MarginAccount.settleBadDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L382) function.

The problem is that the `buyCollateralFromAuction()` function doesn't execute the [settlePendingObligation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L153) which can be problematic because the `MarginAccount` contract may be issuing credit (backed by nothing) because there is not any `vUSD` in the `MarginContract`. Please consider the next scenario:

1. For some reason, the `MarginAccount` and the `InsuranceFund` contracts don't not have `vUSD`.
2. The [ClearingHouse contract needs a credit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L158) in order to pay the trading fees. So the `MarginAccount` issues `vUSD` [backed by nothing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L633).
3. The `MarginAccount` settle a bad debt trader and it [auctions the trader collateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L402-L410). Additionally it [increase the pending debt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L398) but since the `InsuranceFund` does not have `vUSD` the `MarginAcount` still doesn't have `vUSD`.
4. Someone buys the collateral via [buyCollateralFromAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L184) and he transfers [vusd to the InsuranceContract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L192). Now the `InsuranceFund` has `vUSD` but it does not pay his pending debts.
5. `ClearingHouse` [continues to generate trading fees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L158) and the `MarginAccount` continues to create credit backed by nothing.
6. The `vUSD` starts to inflates so much.

## Impact

When someone buys an auctioned collateral via [buyCollateralFromAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L184C14-L184C38), the function must [paid the pending obligations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L153) because the `vUSD` could be inflated so much because the credit issued by `MarginAccount` will be continue [to be created by nothing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L633) if `MarginAcount` does not have `vUSD`. 

## Code Snippet

The [settlePendingObligation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L153) and [buyCollateralFromAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L184) functions:

```solidity
File: InsuranceFund.sol

154:         if (pendingObligation > 0) {
155:             uint toTransfer = Math.min(vusd.balanceOf(address(this)), pendingObligation);
156:             if (toTransfer > 0) {
157:                 pendingObligation -= toTransfer;
158:                 vusd.safeTransfer(marginAccount, toTransfer);

194: 
195:         // close auction if no collateral left
196:         if (IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) == 0) {
197:             auctions[token].startedAt = 0;
198:         }
199:     }

## Recommendation

Execute the [settlePendingObligations()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L153) at the end of the [buyCollateralFromAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L184) function.
