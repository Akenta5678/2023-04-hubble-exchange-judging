# Precision loss errors in MarginAccount._seizeToRepay() due to mismatched token decimals for tokens != 6 decimals

## Summary
Precision loss errors will happen in MarginAccount._seizeToRepay() when using tokens with a different precision to the hard-coded decimal (1e6)

## Vulnerability Detail
take a look at this snippet below
```solidity
function _seizeToRepay(LiquidationBuffer memory buffer, uint seize) internal pure returns (uint repay) {//@audit  mismatched precisions scaling
        repay = seize * buffer.priceCollateral / (10 ** buffer.decimals);//@audit-info priceCollateral is scaled to 6 decimals
        if (buffer.incentivePerDollar > 0) {
            repay = repay * PRECISION / buffer.incentivePerDollar;
        }
    }
```

here in Ln 526, 
```solidity
 repay = seize * buffer.priceCollateral / (10 ** buffer.decimals);
```
`buffer.priceCollateral` (i.e oracle price) is always in 6 decimals but  `buffer.decimals` (i.e supported collateral token's decimal) can be anything.  And also `PRECISION` is hardcoded 1e6

So the issue is that dividing the seize * oracle price that's in 6 decimals by  buffer.decimals which may != 1e6 will cause precision loss errors

 And also the first faulty calculation is still multiplied by `PRECISION` which hardcoded 1e6 and divided by  `buffer.incentivePerDollar`  here in Ln 528
```solidity
  repay = repay * PRECISION / buffer.incentivePerDollar;
```

 buffer.incentivePerDollar according to this comment by the devs [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L45) could be >= 1e6

There could be a situation where:
buffer.priceCollateral = in 1e6,
buffer.decimals = 1e18,
buffer.incentivePerDollar = not equal to neither 1e6 nor 1e18

## Impact
`repay` will be incorrect due to the precision issues

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
you'll need to scale `buffer.decimals` in an if statement for tokens whose decimals != 1e6 
Also you'll need to maybe scale `buffer.incentivePerDollar` in an if statement incase its not in 1e6
