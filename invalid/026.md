# Untrusted contract calls

## Summary
 `processWithdrawals()` function in VUSD.sol is allowed external call.

## Vulnerability Detail
The withdrawal.usr.call{value: withdrawal.amount}("") line is executing a call to another contract (or externally owned account) that is determined by the withdrawal.usr address. This is known as a "low-level" call in Solidity, which allows an arbitrary function to be executed on the contract at the withdrawal.usr address

## Impact
Token might be lose.
