# Replay Signature by exploiting the missing block chain id and salt validation

## Summary

The report highlights a vulnerability in the code related to signature verification, which allows for replay attacks and cross-chain signature replay due to the missing blockchain ID and nonce.

## Vulnerability Detail

The code snippet provided shows the `verifySigner` function, which aims to verify the signer's address using a provided signature. The function recovers the signer's address from the order hash and compares it with the `order.trader` value.

The `orderHash` is derived from the `Order` struct, which includes various order details such as the market ID, trader address, base asset quantity, price, salt, and reduce-only flag. However, the issue arises from the missing implementation to ensure the uniqueness and incrementation of the salt/nonce value. Without an on-chain mechanism to enforce unique and incremented nonces, the vulnerability allows for signature replay attacks.

Additionally, the absence of the blockchain ID in the `Order` struct opens the possibility of cross-chain signature replay attacks.

## Impact

The vulnerability enables replay attacks and cross-chain signature replay, potentially allowing malicious actors to reuse valid signatures in different contexts or across different blockchains, compromising the security and integrity of the system.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerable code snippet can be found [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/1f9a5ed0ca8f6004bbb7b099ecbb8ae796557849/hubble-protocol/contracts/orderbooks/OrderBook.sol#L410).

## Tool Used

The vulnerability was identified through a manual review.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, the following measures are recommended:

1. Implement an on-chain mechanism to ensure the uniqueness and incrementation of the salt or nonce value in each order. This will prevent replay attacks by ensuring that each order has a unique identifier.

2. Include the blockchain ID in the `Order` struct to prevent cross-chain signature replay attacks. The blockchain ID should be part of the type hash used in the order hash calculation.

By implementing these recommendations, the system can avoid signature replay attacks and cross-chain signature replay vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall security and reliability of the platform.
