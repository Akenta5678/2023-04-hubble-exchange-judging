# Use `call()` instead of `transfer()` on address payable

## Summary

Using the `transfer()` function on the address payable is not recommended.

```solidity
HGT.sol

43: payable(_toAddress).transfer(_amount);
```

## Vulnerability Detail

The `transfer()` function forward a fixed amount of 2300 gas. The gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.

## Impact

The use of the deprecated `transfer()` function when transferring `ETH` will inevitably make the transaction fail when:

-   The claimer smart contract does not implement a payable function.
-   The claimer smart contract does implement a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit.
-   The claimer smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300.
-   Additionally, using higher than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.

## Recommendation

I recommend using `call()` method instead of `transfer()`.
