# Possibility of frontrunning due to public order matching.

## Summary
Possibility of frontrunning due to public order matching. `executeMatchedOrders` function is public and processes the matching of orders. This can allow a malicious miner to front-run order matching.

## Vulnerability Detail
The executeMatchedOrders function in the provided smart contract code processes the matching of orders. This function is marked as external, which means it can be called from outside the contract (i.e., it's public).

Example:
A legitimate user (Alice) calls executeMatchedOrders with a pair of orders she wants to match and a fill amount. She signs and submits this transaction to the Ethereum network.
Before her transaction is mined into a block, a malicious miner or another user (Bob) sees Alice's transaction in the pool of pending transactions.
Bob decides to front-run Alice. He prepares his own transaction, where he calls executeMatchedOrders with the same pair of orders as Alice but provides a higher gas price for his transaction. This higher gas price incentivizes miners to include his transaction in the blockchain before Alice's.
If Bob's transaction gets mined first, he could potentially extract some value that Alice would have received.

## Impact
If the frontrunner is successful, the original user (Alice in our example) could suffer economic losses.

## Recommendation
use a decentralized oracle for time-sensitive actions to mitigate the risk of miner frontrunning.
