# Oracle.sol#getUnderlyingPrice() - possible wrong decimals due to arbitrary token

## Summary
The stated function takes the price from the AggregatorV3 and divides it by 100, knowing that the **usual** answer would be 8 decimals, reducing it to 6 to use with USDC, but not all tokens have 8 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail
While most USD price feeds use 8 decimals, some use less than or more than 8 decimals, which would break calculations requiring precision with the price returned.

## Impact
Wrong calculations in all contracts using the oracle when working with arbitrary tokens that would be implemented later on in the protocol. Potential rounding to 0.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Scale the decimals returned to 6 using ``AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).decimals()`` in this case to calculate the correct decimals.
