# Insecure Ether Transfer in Withdraw Function

## Summary
the payable(_toAddress).transfer(_amount) method is used for transferring Ether to the _toAddress in the _creditTo function. While this method is commonly used for Ether transfers, it has a limitation.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/hubble-exchange/hubble-protocol/blob/3a6b576eeedc323c70feb3808c665228e5f9b8a5/contracts/HGT.sol#L32C1-L48
    function _creditTo(address _toAddress, uint _amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused returns(uint) {
        // check for amount and user
        require(
            _amount != 0 && _toAddress != address(0x0),
            "HGT: Insufficient amount or invalid user"
        );


        // scale amount to 18 decimals
        _amount *= SCALING_FACTOR;


        // transfer amount to user
        payable(_toAddress).transfer(_amount); @audit


        circulatingSupply += _amount;
        return _amount;
    }



## Impact
The transfer function has a gas stipend of 2,300 gas units that it forwards to the receiving contract's fallback function. If the fallback function consumes more than 2,300 gas units or performs any expensive operations, the transfer may fail, resulting in a loss of funds.
## Code Snippet
    function _creditTo(address _toAddress, uint _amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused returns(uint) {
        // check for amount and user
        require(
            _amount != 0 && _toAddress != address(0x0),
            "HGT: Insufficient amount or invalid user"
        );


        // scale amount to 18 decimals
        _amount *= SCALING_FACTOR;


        // transfer amount to user
        payable(_toAddress).transfer(_amount); @audit


        circulatingSupply += _amount;
        return _amount;
    }

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To handle transfers more securely and avoid potential issues, it's recommended to use the call function instead of transfer when transferring Ether to a contract. This allows you to specify a higher gas limit or provide additional parameters if needed.
