# `withdraw` function does not check if the amount to be withdrawn is available

## Summary
This function allows a user to withdraw a certain `_amount` from the contract. The contract checks if the user has sent at least `_amount` Ether along with the transaction, but it doesn't check whether the contract itself has enough balance to facilitate the withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail
In a scenario where the contract does not have sufficient funds, an attempt to withdraw may still go through, leading to potential issues or contract failure. This can cause loss of funds or put the contract into an undesirable state.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A potential fix for this would be to include a requirement statement that checks the contract's balance before attempting the withdrawal.
e.g 
```solidity
require(address(this).balance >= _amount, "HGT: Contract has insufficient funds for withdrawal");
```
