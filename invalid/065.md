# frontrunning buyCollateralFromAuction()

## Summary
The "buyCollateralFromAuction" function, front-running is a potential vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate their transactions and purchase collateral assets before other participants.
## Vulnerability Detail
The "buyCollateralFromAuction" function is vulnerable to front-running attacks.
Attackers monitor transactions invoking the function.
They submit their own transactions with higher gas prices to execute first.
This allows them to purchase collateral assets before other participants.
This will make other users of the protocal missout on opportunities.

## Impact
Front-running in the "buyCollateralFromAuction" function erodes trust, discourages participation, and causes loss of opportunities for legitimate participants, damaging the platform's reputation and potential profits.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/hubble-exchange/hubble-protocol/blob/3a6b576eeedc323c70feb3808c665228e5f9b8a5/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L184C1-L200
    function buyCollateralFromAuction(address token, uint amount) override external {
        Auction memory auction = auctions[token];
        // validate auction
        require(_isAuctionOngoing(auction.startedAt, auction.expiryTime), "IF.no_ongoing_auction");
        // transfer funds
        uint vusdToTransfer = _calcVusdAmountForAuction(auction, token, amount);
        address buyer = _msgSender();
        vusd.safeTransferFrom(buyer, address(this), vusdToTransfer);
        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(buyer, amount); // will revert if there wasn't enough amount as requested
        // close auction if no collateral left
        if (IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) == 0) {
            auctions[token].startedAt = 0;
        }
    }

## Recommendation
Batch auctions to randomize the order of transactions and reduce the predictability of front-running.
