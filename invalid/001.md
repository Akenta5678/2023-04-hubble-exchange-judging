# BROKEN ACCESS CONTROL

## Summary

One of the functions suffers from a broken access control.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a potential broken access control vulnerability due to the transfer of funds to the **marginAccount** address without explicit access control checks.

## Impact

The **settlePendingObligation** function allows anyone to call it and transfer VUSD tokens from the contract to the **marginAccount** without proper access control. This can lead to unauthorized transfers and potential manipulation of funds.

The **depositFor** function calls **settlePendingObligation** before executing the deposit. If there is a pending obligation (i.e., non-zero pendingObligation), the function reverts and prevents the deposit. However, the access control vulnerability in **settlePendingObligation** could still be exploited by calling **settlePendingObligation** directly.

```solidity
    function depositFor(address to, uint amount) override public {
        settlePendingObligation();
        // we want to protect new LPs, when the insurance fund is in deficit
        require(pendingObligation == 0, "IF.deposit.pending_obligations");

        uint _pool = _totalPoolValue();
        uint _totalSupply = totalSupply();
        uint vusdBalance = balance();
        if (_totalSupply == 0 && vusdBalance > 0) { // trading fee accumulated while there were no IF LPs
            vusd.safeTransfer(governance(), vusdBalance);
            _pool = 0;
        }

        vusd.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount);
        uint shares = 0;
        if (_pool == 0) {
            shares = amount;
        } else {
            shares = amount * _totalSupply / _pool;
        }
        _mint(to, shares);
        emit FundsAdded(to, amount, _blockTimestamp());
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement access control modifiers such as **onlyOwner** or **onlyAuthorized** to restrict the execution of critical functions, including the transfer of funds. These modifiers should be applied to functions like **settlePendingObligation** and any other functions that involve the transfer of tokens.

Introduce RBAC mechanisms where specific roles or addresses are granted permissions to execute certain functions. This ensures that only authorized entities can perform transfers and access sensitive operations. The **marginAccount** address should have the appropriate role assigned to it.
