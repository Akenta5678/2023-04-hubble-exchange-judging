# Lack of the limitation how many orders a trader can assign into the `orders` parameter of the OrderBook#`placeOrders()`/ the OrderBook#`cancelOrders()`, which lead to that the transaction will be reverted in the for-loop due to reaching the gas limit

## Summary
There is no limitation how many orders a trader can assign into the `orders` parameter of the OrderBook#`placeOrders()` / the OrderBook#`cancelOrders()` in order to place/cancel them.

If a trader assign too many orders into the `orders` parameter in order to place/cancel them when the trader call the OrderBook#`placeOrders()`, the transaction will be reverted in the for-loop due to reaching the gas limit. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When a trader place the orders, the OrderBook#`placeOrders()` would be called.
Within the OrderBook#`placeOrders()`, multiple orders can be assigned into the `orders` parameter by the caller (trader).
And then, each order would be executed with the iteration by using for-loop like this:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/orderbooks/OrderBook.sol#L94-L97
```solidity
    function placeOrders(Order[] memory orders) public whenNotPaused { /// @audit
        address trader = orders[0].trader;
        int[] memory posSizes = _getPositionSizes(trader);
        uint reserveAmount;
        for (uint i = 0; i < orders.length; i++) {  /// @audit
            require(orders[i].trader == trader, "OB_trader_mismatch");
            reserveAmount += _placeOrder(orders[i], posSizes[orders[i].ammIndex]);
        }
        if (reserveAmount != 0) {
            marginAccount.reserveMargin(trader, reserveAmount);
        }
    }
```

When a trader place the orders, the OrderBook#`cancelOrders()` would be called.
Within the OrderBook#`cancelOrders()`, multiple orders can be assigned into the `orders` parameter by the caller (trader).
And then, each order would be executed with the iteration by using for-loop like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/orderbooks/OrderBook.sol#L172
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/orderbooks/OrderBook.sol#L175-L178
```solidity
    function cancelOrders(Order[] memory orders) override public {
        address trader = orders[0].trader;
        uint releaseMargin;
        for (uint i; i < orders.length; i++) { /// @audit
            require(orders[i].trader == trader, "OB_trader_mismatch");
            releaseMargin += _cancelOrder(orders[i]);
        }
        if (releaseMargin != 0) {
            marginAccount.releaseMargin(trader, releaseMargin);
        }
    }
```

However, there is no limitation how many orders a trader can assign into the `orders` parameter of the OrderBook#`placeOrders()`/ the OrderBook#`cancelOrders()` in order to place/cancel them.
If a trader assign too many orders into the `orders` parameter in order to place/cancel them when the trader call the OrderBook#`placeOrders()`/  the OrderBook#`cancelOrders()`, the transaction will be reverted in the for-loop due to reaching the gas limit. 

## Impact
If a trader assign too many orders into the `orders` parameter in order to place/cancel them when the trader call the OrderBook#`placeOrders()`/ the OrderBook#`cancelOrders()`, the transaction will be reverted in the for-loop due to reaching the gas limit.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the OrderBook#`placeOrders()` and the OrderBook#`cancelOrders()`:
- consider setting a limitation how many orders can assign into the `orders` parameter when the trader call the OrderBook#`placeOrders()`
- And then, consider adding a input validation to check whether or not the orders assigned into the `orders` parameter would exceed the limitation so that the transaction avoid to be reverted in the for-loop due to reaching the gas limit.
