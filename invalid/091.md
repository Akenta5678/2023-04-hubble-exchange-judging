# Single Auction Restriction could lead to user under bad debt

## Summary

Protocol includes a mechanism for conducting auctions following a bad debt settlement. However, it currently restricts auctions to only one per token at a time, and auctions have a relatively short duration of two hours.

## Vulnerability Detail
An auction is started when someone settle badDebt on `MarginAccount.sol` : 
```solidity
        // Insurance fund gets all the available collateral
        uint[] memory seized = new uint[](assets.length);
        for (uint i = 1 /* skip vusd */; i < assets.length; i++) {
            int amount = margin[i][trader];
            if (amount > 0) {
                margin[i][trader] = 0;
                assets[i].token.safeTransfer(address(insuranceFund), amount.toUint256());
                seized[i] = amount.toUint256();
                insuranceFund.startAuction(address(assets[i].token));
            }
        }
```
For each collateral token owned by `trader`, an auction will be started
The InsuranceFund contract's `startAuction(address token)` function includes a check to ensure an auction is not already in progress for the same token. If an auction is ongoing `(_isAuctionOngoing(auctions[token].startedAt, auctions[token].expiryTime))`, a new auction will not be started.
```solidity
//E Only on auction per collateral token
if(!_isAuctionOngoing(auctions[token].startedAt, auctions[token].expiryTime)) {
    uint currentPrice = uint(oracle.getUnderlyingPrice(token));
    uint currentTimestamp = _blockTimestamp();
    auctions[token] = Auction(
        currentPrice * startPriceMultiplier / PRECISION,
        currentTimestamp,
        currentTimestamp + auctionDuration
    );
}
```
In case of crash or simply in a big price move, multiples users could be in bad debt situation, however an auction could only be started for one of them regarding the fact that an auction can only be started by one collateral token.


## Impact

The restriction of one auction per token at a time may delay the auctioning of seized collateral if multiple bad debts that include the same token are settled simultaneously. 
In bad conditions where there is a token price crash, multiples users could have bad debt being settle but with this single token restrictions this bad debt would not be settle which imply bigger bad debt for them and for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe implement some auctions per users on the mapping 
```solidity
//E token => Auction Struct
- mapping(address => Auction) public auctions;
//E token => userInDebt => Auction Struct
+ mapping(address => mapping(address => Auction)) public auctions;
```
