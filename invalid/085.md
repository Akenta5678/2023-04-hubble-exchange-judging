# `MarginAccountHelper` contract had a problem can lead  to drain funds

## Summary
- problem occure into the calling contract  that can cause contract to drain and lose funds by an attacker 
## Vulnerability Detail
a problem  when call an external contract and it calls back into the calling contract before the first call is finished so the problem In this case, `vusd.mintWithReserve` in the L46 and L64 , `marginAccount.addMarginFor` in the L47, `marginAccount.removeMarginFor` in the L55, `vusd.withdrawTo` in the L56 and L74 , `vusd.processWithdrawals` in the L57 and L75, `insuranceFund.depositFor` in the L65, `insuranceFund.withdrawFor` in the L73 this are vulnerable to re-entrancy do if an attacker can exploit and know how to play with this using and exploit contract it's can drain the contract's funds.
## Impact
an attacker could drain the contract's funds by calling the `vusd.mintWithReserve` function multiple times. The `vusd.mintWithReserve` function mints new VUSD tokens and deposits them into the calling contract. If the attacker calls this function multiple times before the contract has had a chance to update its state, they can mint an unlimited amount of VUSD tokens and drain the contract's funds.
- the output of the poc that can use by an attacker :
```js
Transaction mined successfully!
Contract execution reverted with the following reason:
Not enough VUSD in margin account
```
- the contract reverts because the attacker does not have enough `VUSD` in their margin account to cover the withdrawal.
