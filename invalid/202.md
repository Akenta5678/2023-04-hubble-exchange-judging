# Incorrect spread validation when `spreadLimit >= 1e6`

## Summary
Spread is overvalidated when `spreadLimit >= 1e6`, preventing orders that should be filled to be unable to fill.

## Vulnerability Detail
Based on the inline documentation, having `spreadLimit` set to 1e6 means that 100% variation is allowed, meaning that the protocol should not be preventing any kind of orders from being filled due to too high a spread in price.

> "if spreadLimit >= 1e6 it means that 100% variation is allowed which means shorts at $0 will also pass."

A special case is handled for when `spreadLimit` is set to 1e6 for the lower bound. If `spreadLimit == 1e6`, then even a short price of $0 will be filled. This is clearly intended by the protocol. However, for the upper bound, it continues to limit price to the bound of `oraclePrice * (1e6 + spreadLimit) / 1e6`. This means that even in a supposed allowed "100% variation", if filled price fluctuates outside of more than 2x the oracle price, it forces a revert, but this should not be the case due to the rules set by `spreadLimit`.

## Impact
Spread is overvalidated which prevents orders that are supposed to go through from going through due to upper bound check.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the case where `spreadLimit >= 1e6`, we should free up the upper limit and allow trades of all prices to go through just like the lower bound.
