# HGT/HGTCore/HGTRemote - arbitrary size of _toAddress can cause a channel block

## Summary
The application relies on the default blocking behavior, which can cause blockage of networks with different gas limits.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ``_toAddress`` parameter passed around the functions is a bytes array of arbitrary size, which is often packed into payloads with other variables. This can create a scenario where a large enough payload can block the channel by reverting back to the default Lz blocking. An attacker can pass an address with such a big payload, that gas constraints between chains wouldn't account for and would force an OOG.
## Impact
Great loss of funds and breakage of the protocol and it's intended behavior.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Limit the length of _toAddress to some amount (i.e. 256 bytes). Check for the length before sending the message via a ``require(_toAddress.length <= maxAddressLength);``.
