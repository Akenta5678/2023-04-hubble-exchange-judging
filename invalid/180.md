# User with high PnL can avoid liquidation fee

## Summary

Hubble enforces margin restriction to ensure sufficient collateral is available to cover potential losses. It incentivizes responsible trading by charging a liquidation fee on every liquidated account.  A user can withdraw all of their capital to avoid paying any liquidation fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol accounts all unrealized profit and loss toward the users margin in [`getNotionalPositionAndMarginVanilla`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol#L417).
With a large and positive PnL the user can [remove all of margin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/MarginAccount.sol#L650-L655) from the protocol.


## Impact
With a sudden price drops, as common in the [volatile cryptocurrency market](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-gmx-judging/issues/154), the PnL goes down and the users is getting liquidated. 
The liquidated user cannot pay the liquidation fee as they no longer have collateral left. The loss has to be covered by the insurance instead.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The user must have enough collateral in their balance to cover any liquidation fee. The margin model should be changed to not account a positive pnL towards the user balance.

```diff
function getNotionalPositionAndMarginVanilla(address trader, bool includeFundingPayments, Mode mode)
        public
        view
        returns(uint256 notionalPosition, int256 margin)
    {
        int256 unrealizedPnl;
        margin = marginAccount.getNormalizedMargin(trader);
        if (includeFundingPayments) {
            margin -= getTotalFunding(trader); // -ve fundingPayment means trader should receive funds
        }
        (notionalPosition, unrealizedPnl) = getTotalNotionalPositionAndUnrealizedPnl(trader, margin, mode);
-       margin += unrealizedPnl;
+       margin += min(unrealizedPnl, 0);
     }
```
