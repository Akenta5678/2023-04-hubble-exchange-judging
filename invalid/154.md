# Nonces is not used in signed data, causing replay attacks

## Summary
Nonces is not used in signed data, causing replay attacks

## Vulnerability Detail
In OrderBook.sol,

```Solidity 
File: contracts/orderbooks/OrderBook.sol

410    function verifySigner(Order memory order, bytes memory signature) public view returns (address, bytes32) {
411        bytes32 orderHash = getOrderHash(order);
412        address signer = ECDSAUpgradeable.recover(orderHash, signature);
413        require(signer == order.trader, "OB_SINT");
414        return (signer, orderHash);
415    }
416
417    function getOrderHash(Order memory order) public view returns (bytes32) {
418        return _hashTypedDataV4(keccak256(abi.encode(ORDER_TYPEHASH, order)));
419    }
```

The verifySigner() function varifies the signer using ECDSAUpgradeable.recover() which takes two params like orderHash and signature. orderHash is passed by  getOrderHash(). Order is a struct with data is getting passed to get the hash. The order struct is given as below,

```Solidity
File: contracts/Interfaces.sol

110    struct Order {
111        uint256 ammIndex;
112        address trader;
113        int256 baseAssetQuantity;
114        uint256 price;
115        uint256 salt;
116        bool reduceOnly;
117    }
```
Nonce is missing here in signed data. A nonce can prevent an old value from being used when a new value exists. Without one, two transactions submitted in one order, can appear in a block in a different order. 

**EIP-712 has stressed on security issues like Replay attacks which is possible here and Frontrunning attacks.**
Reference link- https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712

For example: 
If a user is attacked, then tries to change the recipient address to a more secure address, initially chooses an insecure compromised one, but immediately notices the problem, then re-submits as a different, uncompromised address, a malicious miner can change the order of the transactions, so the insecure one is the one that ends up taking effect, letting the attacker transfer the funds. To prevent it nonce must be used in signed data.

Taking another example from Mastering Ethereum book,
> Imagine you wish to make two transactions. You have an important payment to make of 6 ether, and also another payment of 8 ether. You sign and broadcast the 6-ether transaction first, because it is the more important one, and then you sign and broadcast the second, 8-ether transaction. Sadly, you have overlooked the fact that your account contains only 10 ether, so the network can’t accept both transactions: one of them will fail. Because you sent the more important 6-ether one first, you understandably expect that one to go through and the 8-ether one to be rejected. However, in a decentralized system like Ethereum, nodes may receive the transactions in either order; there is no guarantee that a particular node will have one transaction propagated to it before the other. As such, it will almost certainly be the case that some nodes receive the 6-ether transaction first and others receive the 8-ether transaction first. Without the nonce, it would be random as to which one gets accepted and which rejected. However, with the nonce included, the first transaction you sent will have a nonce of, let’s say, 3, while the 8-ether transaction has the next nonce value (i.e., 4). So, that transaction will be ignored until the transactions with nonces from 0 to 3 have been processed, even if it is received first. Phew!
