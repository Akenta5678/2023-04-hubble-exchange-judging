# MarginAccount.sol.addMarginFor may break if underlying token is upgraded to have fees

## Summary
The USDC, is an upgradeable contract. If USDC upgrades to have a fee-on-transfer behavior, the contracts in this project will break.

## Vulnerability Detail
One of the tokens supported by this project is USDC, which is an upgradeable contract. If USDC ever upgrades to have a fee-on-transfer, rebasing behavior, or some other non-standard behavior, the contract will have problems in performing calculations and the user will be awarded more than the actual amount of the deposit. For example, MarginAccount.sol.addMarginFor function is using to post margin for another account. 

```solidity
    function addMarginFor(uint idx, uint amount, address to) override public whenNotPaused {
        require(amount > 0, "Add non-zero margin");
        // will revert for idx >= supportedCollateral.length
        if (idx == VUSD_IDX) {
            _transferInVusd(_msgSender(), amount);
        } else {
            supportedCollateral[idx].token.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount);
        }
        margin[idx][to] += amount.toInt256();
        emit MarginAdded(to, idx, amount, _blockTimestamp());
    }
```

There are a lot of other examples where the balances aren't checked.

## Impact
contract will have problems in performing calculations and the user will be awarded more than the actual amount of the deposit.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Measure balances before and after transfers, and use the difference as the amount rather than the stated amount.
