# Setting referral code tx can be frontrunned

## Summary
Setting referral code tx can be frontrunned

## Vulnerability Detail
Referral code is based on a FCFS basis. This means that an attacker can monitor the mempool for incoming registration of a referral code and simply frontrun the tx (and claim the referral code). 

## Impact
- Users may not be able to set the referral code as desired.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Some potential mitigations:
- Use some random hashes mixed in the supplied referral code, instead of letting the msg.sender able to deterministically select their own referral code.
