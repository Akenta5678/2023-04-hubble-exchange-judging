# HGT.sol#_creditTo() - use of .transfer() potentially can break the protocol in the future

## Summary
A generally bad and advised against practice is used in the ``_creditTo()`` function of this contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The use of ``.transfer()`` in the contract may have unintended outcomes on the eth being sent to the receiver. Eth may be irretrievable or undelivered if the ``msg.sender`` or  ``_toAddress`` is a smart contract. 
## Impact
Funds can potentially be lost.
A detailed explanation of why relying on payable().transfer() may result in unexpected loss of eth can be found [here](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)

## Recommendation
Use .call, while accounting for reentrancy, or use OpenZeppelin libraries.
