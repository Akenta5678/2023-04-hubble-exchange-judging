# Possible manipulation in getOpenNotionalWhileReducingPosition()

## Summary
The function `getOpenNotionalWhileReducingPosition()` in the `AMM` contract calculate profit of user will make if reducing the position size. This information can be used to determine the best time to trade against the position.
However, if the function is public, anyone can use it to calculate the open conditional and realized PNL of your position. This information can be used by a malicious player to manipulate your trade.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function is vulnerable to front-running because it does not take into account the order in which the transactions are submitted. This means that an attacker could submit a transaction to reduce their position before a large order to buy or sell the asset is submitted. This would allow the attacker to front-run the large order and profit from the price movement.
## Impact
`getOpenNotionalWhileReducingPosition()` function to calculate that you will earn $10 if you reduce your position. The malicious player then executes a transaction to buy the asset at $100. Once your transaction is executed, the malicious actor's transaction will be executed immediately after. The malicious actor will then sell the asset for $110, making a profit of $10.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the visibility from `public` to:
 `private` : It is used to grant access only within a contract.
or `internal`: It is used to grant access within the contract and all the contracts that inherit it.
 This would prevent anyone from calling the function without permission. However, this would make the feature less accessible to developers who need to us.e it.
