# Reentrancy Vulnerability due to Misuse of nonReentrant Modifier in `processWithdrawals` Function

## Summary

The `VUSD.sol` contract, which represents the VUSD wrapper over USDC in Hubble Exchange, contains a potential reentrancy vulnerability. This is due to the improper use of the `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ReentrancyGuard` contract. The vulnerability resides in the `processWithdrawals()` function, which is responsible for processing the queued withdrawals. The problem stems from the fact that the state variable `start` is updated at the end of the function after potentially calling external contracts, which can allow for reentrant calls.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract maintains a `withdrawals` array, which holds all pending withdrawals, and the `start` state variable points to the start of the pending withdrawals in the array. In the `processWithdrawals()` function, it goes through the withdrawals one by one, sends the gas token to the user, and then increments `start` to move the pointer forward. However, `start` is updated after potentially calling an external contract.

Specifically, the line `(bool success, bytes memory data) = withdrawal.usr.call{value: withdrawal.amount}("");` makes a call to an external contract, as `withdrawal.usr` can be any arbitrary address. This call sends `withdrawal.amount` worth of Ether to the address `withdrawal.usr`.

In the context of reentrancy, if `withdrawal.usr` is a malicious contract, it can make reentrant calls to `processWithdrawals()`, and since `start` is updated only at the end, it can cause the same withdrawal to be processed multiple times, leading to potential loss of Ether from the contract.

## Impact

This vulnerability can potentially lead to financial losses for the contract as the malicious user can withdraw more funds than they are entitled to.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerability can be found in the `processWithdrawals` function in the `VUSD.sol` contract:

```solidity
function processWithdrawals() external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    ...
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = withdrawal.usr.call{value: withdrawal.amount}("");
    ...
    start = i;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this potential vulnerability, consider updating `start` before making the external call, and rechecking the condition `start < withdrawals.length && (start - base) < maxWithdrawalProcesses` after every withdrawal process.

The corrected code should look something like this:

```solidity
function processWithdrawals() external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    uint base = start;
    uint reserve = address(this).balance;
    while (start < withdrawals.length && (start - base) < maxWithdrawalProcesses) {
        require(reserve >= withdrawals[start].amount, 'Not enough balance');
        Withdrawal memory withdrawal = withdrawals[start];
        if (reserve < withdrawal.amount) {
            break;
        }

        // increment start before making the external call
        start += 1;

        (bool success, bytes memory data) = withdrawal.usr.call{value: withdrawal.amount}("");
        if (success) {
            reserve -= withdrawal.amount;
        } else {
            emit WithdrawalFailed(withdrawal.usr, withdrawal.amount, data);
        }
    }
}
```

## Proof Of Concept

1. Deploy the VUSD.sol contract on a local Ethereum network or mainnet fork.
2. Create a malicious contract that calls the `processWithdrawals` function in its fallback function.
3. Make a withdrawal from the VUSD contract to the malicious contract.
4. Call the `processWithdrawals` function from any account.
5. The malicious contract's fallback function will be triggered, which will make a reentrant call to `processWithdrawals`.
6. Since `start` is updated only after making the external call, the same withdrawal will be processed multiple times, potentially draining the contract of its Ether balance.
