# possible precision loss in `openPosition()` function

## Summary
The `openPosition` function calculates the liquidationThreshold based on the totalPosSize, maxLiquidationRatio, and minSizeRequirement variables. However, there is a potential issue in the order of operations within the calculation, specifically the division operation before the multiplication.


## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
        positions[order.trader].liquidationThreshold = Math.max((totalPosSize * maxLiquidationRatio / 1e6) + 1, minSizeRequirement
```
The division operation maxLiquidationRatio / 1e6 is performed before the multiplication totalPosSize * maxLiquidationRatio. This may lead to a loss of precision in the result due to the order of operations.


## Impact
Precision Loss: The division operation before the multiplication may result in a loss of precision in the calculated liquidationThreshold value. This can affect the accuracy of the liquidation threshold and potentially lead to incorrect liquidation decisions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address the vulnerability and ensure accurate calculations, the following recommendation is suggested:

Perform the multiplication operation totalPosSize * maxLiquidationRatio before the division operation /(1e6). This can be achieved by using parentheses to group the multiplication first. The updated code would be as follows:
