# There is no need to subtract one to round down

## Summary

When withdraw in HGT, it's right to round down, but there is no need to subtract one, which cause the user to lose money.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function _debitFrom(address, uint _amount) internal virtual override returns(uint) {
        circulatingSupply -= _amount;
        _amount = _amount / SCALING_FACTOR;
        require(_amount > 1, "HGT: Insufficient amount"); // so that _amount != 0 in the next line
        _amount -= 1; // round down when withdrawing
        return _amount;
    }
```
Here the division has finished rounding down, and subtracting 1 will cause the user lose money

## Impact

Incorrect calculations cause users to lose funds
