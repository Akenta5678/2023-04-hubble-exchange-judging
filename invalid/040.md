# Possible Excess Token Burning in _transferInVusd Function

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided smart contract, the function _transferInVusd contains a section where tokens may be burnt. The problem lies in the computation of toBurn, which determines the number of tokens to be burnt. The function doesn't consider the amount of tokens being transferred into the function relative to the credit and contract's current balance (vusd.balanceOf(address(this))). It's therefore possible that more tokens are burnt than are transferred by amount.

```solidity
if (credit > 0) {
    uint toBurn = Math.min(vusd.balanceOf(address(this)), credit);
    credit -= toBurn;
    vusd.burn(toBurn);
}
```

The variable toBurn can potentially be greater than the amount of tokens being transferred into the contract, which could lead to more tokens being burnt than were actually transferred by amount.

## Impact
If the toBurn value is more than the amount of tokens being transferred in, it might lead to burning of tokens that are not supposed to be burnt. This could negatively impact the balance of the contract's tokens, potentially causing it to have fewer tokens than expected.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent this issue, it's suggested to include a check to ensure that toBurn does not exceed the amount of tokens being transferred.
