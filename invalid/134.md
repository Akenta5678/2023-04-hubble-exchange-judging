# VUSD contract -> processWithdrawals function is not updating the withdrawals array

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/VUSD.sol#L65

In the VUSD token contract,  `processWithdrawals`  function doesn't delete the Withdrawal element in the withdrawals array after sending the value to user.  

## Vulnerability Detail

In the contract in order to someone be able to withdraw their funds they call withdraw and the request will be added to `withdrawals` array and some one should call `processWithdrawals` function to send funds to all queue withdraw requests inside the array, But after sending the value for each address function doesn't delete the withdraw request from the element this means If anyone call it multiple times they can drain all of the balance inside the contract since the withdraw requests still present inside the array.


## Impact

1. User mint some tokens 
2. User request to withdraw and the request will be added to withdrawals array
3. Calls `processWithdrawals` multiple times to drain all of the balance inside the contract


## Code Snippet
```solidity
   function processWithdrawals() external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        uint reserve = address(this).balance;
        require(reserve >= withdrawals[start].amount, 'Cannot process withdrawals at this time: Not enough balance');
        uint i = start;
        while (i < withdrawals.length && (i - start) < maxWithdrawalProcesses) {
            Withdrawal memory withdrawal = withdrawals[i];
            if (reserve < withdrawal.amount) {
                break;
            }

            (bool success, bytes memory data) = withdrawal.usr.call{value: withdrawal.amount}("");
            if (success) {
                reserve -= withdrawal.amount;
            } else {
                emit WithdrawalFailed(withdrawal.usr, withdrawal.amount, data);
            }
            i += 1;
        }
        // re-entracy not possible, hence can update `start` at the end
        start = i;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

For deleting an element from array there is two ways but they doesn't work as expected in your case

1. Using `delete` keyword eg: `delete array[index]`, But in this way the length of array  wouldn't change and still be the same and you can't use this method in the function 
2. Using `pop` method eg" `array.pop()`, this method delete the last element of the array and also update the length so in this way you should start iterating the loop from last element of the array and call `array.pop()` after the call was succesful,  **But**  if the call was not succesful you  can't delete the request from the array. So since this method only delete last element if you pass the failed one and continue to the rest of the requests the array will mess up and you also can't use this method

Actually I couldn't understand why you are executing withdrawals this way, in this way regardless you can't delete the requests from an array, if a user want to withdraw they should also pay the gas fee needed for sending the value to other users too and this is not good user experience.
I **recomend** to do withdrawals on `_withdrawTo` function and not using array to execute all withdawals in one go, eg:
```diff
    function _withdrawTo(address to, uint amount) internal {
        require(amount >= 5 * (10 ** PRECISION), "min withdraw is 5 vusd");
        burn(amount); // burn vusd from msg.sender
-       withdrawals.push(Withdrawal(to, amount * SCALING_FACTOR));
+      (bool success, bytes memory data) = to.call{value: amount * SCALING_FACTOR}("");
+      require(success,"withdraw failed")
    }
```
