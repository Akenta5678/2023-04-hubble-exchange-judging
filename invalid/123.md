# Openzeppelin MinimalForwarder.sol is mainly meant for testing and it is not production ready. There is also loss of Ether in current implementation.

## Summary
Openzeppelin MinimalForwarder.sol is mainly meant for testing and it is not production ready. There is also issues raised on loss of unused Ether in meta-transaction by the use of this contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

In MinimalForwarder.sol contract,

```Solidity
File: contracts/MinimalForwarder.sol

5 import { MinimalForwarder as Forwarder } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/metatx/MinimalForwarder.sol";
6  // import { MinimalForwarderUpgradeable } from "@openzeppelin/contracts-7 upgradeable/metatx/MinimalForwarderUpgradeable.sol";
7
8 contract MinimalForwarder is Forwarder {
9
10    function executeRequiringSuccess(ForwardRequest calldata req, bytes calldata signature)
11        external
12        payable
13    {
14        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = execute(req, signature);
15        require(success, string(abi.encodePacked("META_EXEC_FAILED: ", returnData)));
16    }
17}
```

MinimalForwarder.sol contract has used openzeppelin MinimalForwarder.sol contract but this contract is mainly meant for **testing purpose only but it is not production ready as it misses some features**, etc. 

Openzeppelin says,
>MinimalForwarder is mainly meant for testing, as it is missing features to be a good production-ready forwarder. This contract does not intend to have all the properties that are needed for a sound forwarding system. A fully functioning forwarding system with good properties requires more complexity. We suggest you look at other projects such as the GSN which do have the goal of building a system like that.

Openzeppelin suggested to look for GSN contract which is given for sponsor reference only as below,
**GSN forwarder contract link:-** https://github.com/opengsn/gsn/blob/master/packages/contracts/src/forwarder/Forwarder.sol

**It is propose to make ERC2771Forwarder.sol as an enhanced successor to MinimalForwarder as per Github issue,**
**Github issue link:-** https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4346

**In openzeppelin version v4.9.0, MinimalForwarder.sol does not exist as per the import**. It is being enhanced with new version in the form of ERC2771Forwarder.sol contract,

## Impact
**Present issues:**
1) The old version used in contract i.e MinimalForwarder.sol contract does not found in openzeppelin v4.9.0 and this contract is for testing as discussed above.
2) MinimalForwarder.sol has issue with loss of ETH, which is well described in github issue.
**Github issue link:-** https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/3664
3) There is issue on removal of MinimalForwarder.sol, which seems to be removed and not found in v4.9.0.

ERC2771Forwarder.sol
**ERC2771Forwarder.sol contract link:-** https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/metatx/ERC2771Forwarder.sol

**ERC2771Forwarder.sol differs with old version as below:**
1) The old version has used "draft-EIP712.sol" which is deprecated now.
2) There is better implementation of nonce in latest version.
3) **Added the deadline for expiring transactions**
4) The old version has openzeppelin v4.5.0 which is too old. Lots of security patches had happened after that version. The old version also use ECDSA which is vulnerable to signature malleability too. 
5) Overall, this seems to better upgrade wrt security and functionality as compared to old version. The focus here should be more on security.

**A new github issue is proposed to make ERC2771Forwarder.sol a breaking change in v5.0.0**

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Avoid using openzeppelin MinimalForwarder.sol contract as it is for testing as per openzeppelin documentation.
2) A enhanced successor for same [ERC2771Forwarder.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/metatx/ERC2771Forwarder.sol) can be checked. However, it is still being updated and most probably production ready and can be a breaking change in openzeppelin v5.0.0. In such a case, a communication with Openzeppelin can be initiated.

**Note:**
In another issue a ECDSA signature malleability issue is submitted and the mitigation for that to upgrade the openzeppelin library to >4.7.3 or latest version. Therefore to mitigate ECDSA signature malleability openzeppelin library will be updated. In that case the current implementation i.e MinimalForwarder.sol wont work as expected because in v4.9.0, MinimalForwarder.sol does not exist in openzeppelin library and it will give import error and error in execute() function implementation.
