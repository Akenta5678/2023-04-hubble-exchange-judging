# Increasing minSizes will freeze positions

## Summary

Hubble governance can set a parameter called `minSizes` to limit the the minimum trading size accepted on the market. However, increasing or decreasing this parameter by the wrong fraction can result in permanent freezing of positions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Hubble Protocol has two similar parameters:

- `minSizeRequirement` parameter denotes the minium acceptable position size on each AMM market. 
- `minSizes` denote the minimum acceptable trading size 

The comments in the code suggest that `minSizeRequirements` should be equal to `minSizes` and is only stored in the OrderBook for [cheaper assertions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/orderbooks/OrderBook.sol#L41C1-L42).

However, this assumption is incorrect, as increasing `minSizes` will freeze old positions.

1. User creates a position with `baseAssetQuantity` = `minSizes` = `minSizeRequirement` set to 100.
2. Government increases both `minSizeRequirement` and `minSizes` to 200. This means that future positions and trades must have a trade size of at least 200.
3. The user cannot create an order to decrease their position because 100 is not [a multiple](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/orderbooks/OrderBook.sol#L123-L124) of 200 (100 % 200 != 0). Similarly, they cannot be liquidated.


On the other hand, changing `minSizeRequirement` only affects [future positions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/AMM.sol#L161)

## Impact

The user's position cannot be liquidated, and they have no way of realizing any loss. Their position will remain indefinitely, and they can withdraw potential unrealized profit and funding payments from the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Rename the variable `minSizes` in the OrderBook, as it does not have a one-to-one relation to the AMM variable `minSizeRequirement`
2. Enforce that the new parameter is smaller than the previous one and is a multiple of it.

```diff
function updateMinSize(uint ammIndex, int minSize) external onlyGovernance {
+       isMultiple(minSizes[ammIndex], minSize);
	minSizes[ammIndex] = minSize;
}
```
