# Wrong logic issue causes incorrect Auction price

## Summary
Wrong logic issue causes incorrect Auction price

## Vulnerability Detail
In InsuranceFund.sol, getAuctionPrice() is an external function which is used to get the auction price.

```Solidity
File: contracts/InsuranceFund.sol

242    function getAuctionPrice(address token) external view returns (uint) {
243        Auction memory auction = auctions[token];
244        if (_isAuctionOngoing(auction.startedAt, auction.expiryTime)) {
245            return _getAuctionPrice(auction);
246        }
247        return 0;
248    }
```
getAuctionPrice() further calls _getAuctionPrice() to get the price.

```Solidity
File: contracts/InsuranceFund.sol

286    function _getAuctionPrice(Auction memory auction) internal view returns (uint) {
287        uint diff = auction.startPrice * (_blockTimestamp() - auction.startedAt) / auctionDuration;
288        return auction.startPrice - diff;
289    }
```

The issue lies at L-287 which basically calculates the price difference which further substracted at L-288 to get the final price which is displayed to user.

Before we discuss on L-287, lets check the major issue which is causing wrong prices in getAuctionPrice(). 

_isAuctionOngoing() is used as validation to check whether the auction is ongoing or not.

```Solidity
File: contracts/InsuranceFund.sol

291    function _isAuctionOngoing(uint startedAt, uint expiryTime) internal view returns (bool) {
292        if (startedAt == 0) return false;
293        uint currentTimestamp = _blockTimestamp();
294        return startedAt <= currentTimestamp && currentTimestamp <= expiryTime;
295    }
```
check at L-294, it returns startedAt <= currentTimestamp which means the auction startedAt time will be equal or less than block.timestamp.

Now coming back to issue at L-287,

```Solidity

287        uint diff = auction.startPrice * (_blockTimestamp() - auction.startedAt) / auctionDuration;
```
Considering the condition at L-294 here, block.timestamp - block.timestamp will result in 0. The diff will look like this,

```Solidity

287        uint diff = auction.startPrice * 0 / auctionDuration;
```

The final diff will always be 0.

This will cause incorrect price at L-288 which will further report wrong price at getAuctionPrice().

Therefore to prevent this issue, it is recommended that startedAt >= currentTimestamp.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Correct the code as below,

```Solidity

    function _isAuctionOngoing(uint startedAt, uint expiryTime) internal view returns (bool) {
        if (startedAt == 0) return false;
        uint currentTimestamp = _blockTimestamp();
-        return startedAt <= currentTimestamp && currentTimestamp <= expiryTime;
+       return startedAt >= currentTimestamp && currentTimestamp <= expiryTime;
    }
```
