# Misuse of Constructor in Upgradable Contract

## Summary
The smart contract uses the constructor to initialize the `clearing_house` address in the context of an upgradable contract. This approach is problematic because the variable will be initialized in the context of the implementation, not the proxy.

## Vulnerability Detail
In an upgradable contract, the `constructor` is only called when the contract is first created. Therefore, any initialization done in the `constructor `will only affect the implementation contract, not the proxy contract. This means that the `clearing_house` address will not be correctly initialized in the proxy contract, leading to potential issues with the contract's functionality.

## Impact
The impact of this issue is significant. If the `clearing_house` address is not correctly initialized in the proxy contract, it could lead to malfunctioning of the contract. This could potentially result in loss of funds or other unintended consequences.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of using the constructor to initialize the `clearing_house `address, consider including it in the `initialize` function that can be called after the contract is deployed.
