# Funding could be inaccurate due to delayed settlement

## Summary

Funding settlement relies on validators to call `settleFunding()`. However, if the validators do no take settlement action on time, the current funding payment could be inaccurate. 

To mitigate the potential accounting issue, instead of value based funding, rate based method which considers the actual settlement time differences can be used.

## Vulnerability Detail

The funding payment flow of users is as following:
- in `AMM.sol#settleFunding()`, `cumulativePremiumFraction` is updated
- it will further be referred to in `getPendingFundingPayment()` -> `updatePosition()`
- finally, in `ClearingHouse.sol#updatePositions(()`, the funding is paid between users.

236:     function settleFunding()
240:         returns (
241:             int256 premiumFraction,
242:             int256 underlyingPrice,
243:             int256 /* cumulativePremiumFraction */, // required for emitting events
244:             uint256 /* nextFundingTime */
245:         )
246:     {

258:             int256 premium = getMarkPriceTwap() - underlyingPrice;
259:             premiumFraction = (premium * int256(fundingPeriod)) / 1 days;

271:             cumulativePremiumFraction += premiumFraction;
272:         }

371:     function getPendingFundingPayment(address trader)
375:         returns(
376:             int256 takerFundingPayment,
377:             int256 latestCumulativePremiumFraction
378:         )
379:     {

382:         // cache state variables locally for cheaper access and return values
383:         latestCumulativePremiumFraction = cumulativePremiumFraction;
384: 
385:         // Taker
386:         takerFundingPayment = (latestCumulativePremiumFraction - taker.lastPremiumFraction)
387:             * taker.size
388:             / BASE_PRECISION;
389:     }

203:     function updatePosition(address trader)
207:         returns(int256 fundingPayment, int256 latestCumulativePremiumFraction)
208:     {
209:         (
210:             fundingPayment,
211:             latestCumulativePremiumFraction
212:         ) = getPendingFundingPayment(trader);
213:         positions[trader].lastPremiumFraction = latestCumulativePremiumFraction;
214:     }

```

```solidity
File: hubble-protocol/contracts/ClearingHouse.sol
241:     function updatePositions(address trader) override public whenNotPaused {

248:                 (int256 _fundingPayment, int256 cumulativePremiumFraction) = amms[i].updatePosition(trader);

250:                     fundingPayment += _fundingPayment;

254:             // -ve fundingPayment means trader should receive funds
255:             marginAccount.realizePnL(trader, -fundingPayment);
256:             lastFundingPaid[trader] = lastFundingTime;

```

As per the discord discussion, validators are not trusted, hence it is possible that they do not settle funding exactly on time, intentionally or not. 

Noted in `AMM.sol#259` above, the calculation of `premiumFraction` assuming the funding period is exactly the value of `fundingPeriod`, however it might not be the case. The absolute price deviation is used no matter the time difference since last funding settlement.

Say, `premiumFraction` stays constant at 0.1%, `fundingPeriod` is 1 hour, but the validators call `settleFunding()` every 70 min. After 7 hours, the actual funding payment should be 7 * 0.1% = 0.7%. However due to the delay settlement, funding is only paid 6 times, results in 6 * 0.1% = 0.6% payment. The 0.1% difference is the loss/gain for users due to inaccuracy.

The problem is, using the absolute price difference instead of some "rate", any delay of the funding settlement will dilute the real funding rate, and the accounting error could accumulate. 



## Impact

- Funding settlement accounting could be inaccurate. 
- Some users could lose funding payment or some could gain undeserved funding.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use rate based method to calculate funding. The real funding payment should be $rate * time$. In this way, even the settlements are not called on time, errors won't be introduced in accounting.
