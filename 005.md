# Once `stablePrice` is set for an asset, it can no longer be removed --> prices can be stale

## Summary
Once `stablePrice` is set for an asset, it can no longer be removed --> prices can be stale

## Vulnerability Detail
Once `stablePrice` is set for an asset, it can no longer be reset or removed, since `setStablePrice` function cannot set price to 0 (it checks for price > 0) 

## Impact
-  if the process that feeds this stable price is down, then the oracle consumer may get stale prices without knowing that the price is stale.
- If the price is no longer the fed stable price, or if Chainlink supports the token price, then it won't be possible for the​​ Oracle contract to bypass the stableprice and use CL price, since the stable price cannot be set to 0.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Add timestamp for `setStablePrice` if the price will be updated regularly, OR
- Allow setting the price to 0 in `setStablePrice` function
