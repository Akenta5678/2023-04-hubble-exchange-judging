# VUSD.sol#processWithdrawals() - possible lock of funds due to gas griefing

## Summary
In the ``processWithdrawals()`` function the contract loops over all of the queued withdraw requests and executes them, sending the ether back to the ``to`` address of each request. To avoid a DOS the team have implemented a maximum amount of requests that can be covered in one go, but duo to the nature of handling control flow through doing ``.call``, an OOG grief is possible.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/VUSD.sol#L65-L85

Withdrawals that are both successful and unsuccessful get pushed out by moving the left pointer ``start`` upon execution. This seems to be able to avoid potential DOS from a forced revert by just skipping over it, since reverting in the fallback would just return false to the ``bool success``. An edge case to this however would be to use up all of the gas forwarded by the VUSD call and cause the entire tx to revert without pushing out the malicious withdraw request.

## Impact
This problem will lead to a loss of user funds, since users tokens get burned from their balance when they indirectly call the ``_withdrawTo``, meaning they cannot requeue their withdrawal. Those tokens are already lost and their funds are stuck.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforcing users to PULL their funds instead of PUSHING them out through a call would mitigate this risk, since the malicious actor wouldn't have a way to interfere with other peoples requests, unlike with the current function, which can be called by anybody.
