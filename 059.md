# Insurance fund auction incentivises a longer period with pending obligations

## Summary
When assets are seized from a bad debt settlement an auction is started for the assets in order to settle any pending obligations. However the auction price calculation wrongly incentivises users to buy collateral as late as possible, thereby leaving the insurance fund in an unhealthy position longer than necessary.

## Vulnerability Detail
An auction is started for every collateral asset when a trader's bad debt is settled by calling `settleBadDebt` in `MarginAccount.sol`. During this process, `seizeBadDebt` is called which in turn calls `settlePendingObligation`:

```solidity
            uint toTransfer = Math.min(vusd.balanceOf(address(this)), pendingObligation);
            if (toTransfer > 0) {
                pendingObligation -= toTransfer;
                vusd.safeTransfer(marginAccount, toTransfer);
            }
```

The issue in this report is most impactful when there isn't enough vUSD in the insurance pool to cover the pending obligation. At this point an auction is started for each relevant collateral asset at the end of the `settleBadDebt` call.

Whilst `pendingObligation != 0` users cannot deposit to, and more importantly withdraw from, the insurance pool. The purpose of the auction is to sell the seized collateral assets for vUSD so that the pending obligation can be settled back to 0 and the insurance pool can continue to operate as normal.

The auction has a `startPriceMultiplier` that is initialised to 1050000 (5%), and across the duration of the auction the price for the collateral asset changes to incentivise users. A normal user would want to pay as little vUSD as possible for the greatest amount of collateral asset they could.

When calling `buyCollateralFromAuction`, the vUSD input amount is calculated as follows:

```solidity
uint vusdToTransfer = _calcVusdAmountForAuction(auction, token, amount);
```

where `_calcVusdAmountForAuction` calls `_getAuctionPrice` under the hood:

```solidity
        uint diff = auction.startPrice * (_blockTimestamp() - auction.startedAt) / auctionDuration;
        return auction.startPrice - diff;
```

Remember, the user wants to spend as little as possible for the same amount of collateral asset, so they want the auction price to be as low as possible. Based on the formula above, the lowest price is obtained when `diff` is as high as possible, which is at the end of the auction. The auction price decreases (i.e. you pay less vUSD for the same amount of collateral asset) as the auction progresses.

This is bad because it incentivises users to wait until the end of an auction before purchasing assets, which leaves the insurance pool in an unhealthy state for a longer period of time.

## Impact
Users are incentivised to wait until the end of an auction before purchasing seized collateral. The result is that an insurance pool can be left in an unhealthy state (with pending obligations) for a longer period, preventing users from withdrawing when they should be able to given the value of the assets for sale.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The insurance pool should aim to return to a healthy state as soon as possible after bad debt is seized. Assuming the same sliding scale auction logic, the pricing should be reversed so that the caller is incentivised to call `buyCollateralFromAuction` as soon as possible. This can be achieved with the following change:

```diff
diff --git a/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol b/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol
index f2f234b..9ffd1f1 100644
--- a/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol
+++ b/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol

     function _getAuctionPrice(Auction memory auction) internal view returns (uint) {
-        uint diff = auction.startPrice * (_blockTimestamp() - auction.startedAt) / auctionDuration;
+        uint diff = auction.startPrice * (auction.expiryTime - _blockTimestamp()) / auctionDuration;
         return auction.startPrice - diff;
     }
 

```

Potentially might also be worth renaming the auction struct member from `startPrice` to `endPrice` given the change in semantics.
