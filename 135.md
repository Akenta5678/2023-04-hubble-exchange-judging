# Deposit / withdrawal slippage control and use pricePerShare instead of balance when calling the withdrawal worth

## Summary

The report reveals a vulnerability where users can burn their share and receive a significantly suboptimal share in return.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability can be addressed by implementing slippage control during the deposit and withdrawal processes. The code snippet provided demonstrates the `_withdrawFor` function, which lacks slippage control. This function is responsible for withdrawing a specified amount of shares for a user. However, without slippage control, users can potentially receive an inadequate amount when burning their shares.

The impact of this vulnerability is twofold. Firstly, users can deposit assets without receiving the expected share amount, leading to an unfair distribution of shares. Secondly, users can burn their shares and receive no assets or an insufficient amount in return.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `pricePerShare` function should be called instead of directly using the `balance` function. The `pricePerShare` function calculates the appropriate share price based on the total supply and the available balance, accounting for any pending obligations. By utilizing `pricePerShare` instead of `balance`, the risk of receiving suboptimal shares or zero assets can be minimized.

## Code Snippet

The code snippet related to this vulnerability can be found at the following location: [GitHub - InsuranceFund.sol Line 215](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/1f9a5ed0ca8f6004bbb7b099ecbb8ae796557849/hubble-protocol/contracts/InsuranceFund.sol#L215).

## Tool Used

The vulnerability assessment was conducted through manual review.

## Recommendation

To address the vulnerability, it is recommended to introduce slippage control during the deposit and withdrawal processes. This will ensure that users receive a fair and accurate share of assets when performing these actions. Additionally, it is advised to replace the direct usage of the `balance` function with a call to the `pricePerShare` function during withdrawals. This will prevent users from burning their shares and receiving inadequate or zero assets in return.
