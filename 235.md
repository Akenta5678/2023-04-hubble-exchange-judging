# Oracle.sol: typecasting the negative price into positive and using it as correct price is not safe

## Summary

`Oracle.sol` is using the [getRoundData](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-hubble-exchange/blob/main/hubble-protocol/contracts/Oracle.sol#L125) to get the price of an asset with round id.

It directly typecast the price value and returns which will be used in the hubble.

Assuming the negative price as valid is not safe.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function getRoundData(AggregatorV3Interface _aggregator, uint80 _round)
        internal
        view
        returns (
            uint80,
            uint256,
            uint256
        )
    {
        (uint80 round, int256 latestPrice, , uint256 latestTimestamp, ) = _aggregator.getRoundData(_round);
        while (latestPrice <= 0) {
            requireEnoughHistory(round);
            round = round - 1;
            (, latestPrice, , latestTimestamp, ) = _aggregator.getRoundData(round);
        }
        return (round, uint256(latestPrice), latestTimestamp); -------------------->>>>audit. it typecase even if `latestPrice < 0`
    }

## Impact

Using the incorrect data.
typecasting the negative value as uint could lead to large value which would impact the asset price.

we tried to execute the following function in remix with x as -10.

contract checkCal {

    uint public len;
    function example(int x) external payable {
        len =  uint256(x);
    }
}


the output value of `len is 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639926`

## Recommendation

Revert if the price value is negative. Follow the chainlink guidelines while fetching the asset price value.
