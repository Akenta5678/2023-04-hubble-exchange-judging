# The startFunding() function in AMM loss of precision

## Summary
Precision loss in AMM due to division before multiplication
## Vulnerability Detail
Dividing before multiplication can cause precision loss. This is because the result of the division is rounded down to the nearest integer.
## Impact
In the case of the startFunding() function, the precision loss is not significant. This is because the funding period is typically a relatively small number, such as 1 minute or 1 hour.

However, if the funding period were a large number, such as 1 day or 1 week, the precision loss could become significant. In this case, the startFunding() function would need to be modified to avoid precision loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Always use Multiplication before Division 
```solidity
- nextFundingTime = ((_blockTimestamp() + fundingPeriod) / fundingPeriod) * fundingPeriod;
+ nextFundingTime = ((_blockTimestamp() + fundingPeriod) * fundingPeriod) / fundingPeriod;
```
