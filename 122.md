# A malicious user can steal gas when another user calls processWithdrawals

## Summary

processWithdrawals performs someone else's withdrawal, which calls back the user's fallback function, where a malicious user can use up a lot of gas to perform custom operations, such as minting gas tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function removeMarginInUSD(uint256 amount) external {
        address trader = msg.sender;
        marginAccount.removeMarginFor(VUSD_IDX, amount, trader);
        vusd.withdrawTo(trader, amount);
        vusd.processWithdrawals();
    }

    function withdrawFromInsuranceFund(uint256 shares) external {
        address user = msg.sender;
        uint amount = insuranceFund.withdrawFor(user, shares);
        vusd.withdrawTo(user, amount);
        vusd.processWithdrawals();
    }
```

Although users can estimate gas consumption in advance, malicious users can frontrun to add withdraw

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It does not seem necessary to add withdraw queue processing logic
