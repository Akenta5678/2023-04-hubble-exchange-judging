# A malicious user can steal gas when another user calls processWithdrawals

## Summary

processWithdrawals performs someone else's withdrawal, which calls back the user's fallback function, where a malicious user can use up a lot of gas to perform custom operations, such as minting gas tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function removeMarginInUSD(uint256 amount) external {
        address trader = msg.sender;
        marginAccount.removeMarginFor(VUSD_IDX, amount, trader);
        vusd.withdrawTo(trader, amount);
        vusd.processWithdrawals();
    }

    function withdrawFromInsuranceFund(uint256 shares) external {
        address user = msg.sender;
        uint amount = insuranceFund.withdrawFor(user, shares);
        vusd.withdrawTo(user, amount);
        vusd.processWithdrawals();
    }

    /**
     * @notice Process withdrawals in the queue. Sends gas token to the user.
    */
    function processWithdrawals() external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        uint reserve = address(this).balance;
        require(reserve >= withdrawals[start].amount, 'Cannot process withdrawals at this time: Not enough balance');
        uint i = start;
        while (i < withdrawals.length && (i - start) < maxWithdrawalProcesses) {
            Withdrawal memory withdrawal = withdrawals[i];
            if (reserve < withdrawal.amount) {
                break;
            }

            (bool success, bytes memory data) = withdrawal.usr.call{value: withdrawal.amount}("");
            if (success) {
                reserve -= withdrawal.amount;
            } else {
                emit WithdrawalFailed(withdrawal.usr, withdrawal.amount, data);
            }
            i += 1;
        }
        // re-entracy not possible, hence can update `start` at the end
        start = i;
    }
```
A malicious user can use a lot of gas to perform custom operations in fallback function.
Although users can estimate gas consumption in advance, malicious users can frontrun to add withdraw

## Impact

A malicious user can steal gas when another user calls processWithdrawals

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It does not seem necessary to add withdraw queue processing logic Or use specific gas
