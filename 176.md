# Transferring supported pool tokens while totalsupply == 0 will break `despositFor` for the next user

## Summary
By sending supported pool tokens to the insureancefund  while totalsupply == 0, the next user won't receive any shares
## Vulnerability Detail
When calculating the amount of shares to receive, the function has two scenario's:

If the pool is empty, it will see it as initial mint and mint shares according to amount deposited due to the fact that totalSupply = 0 then. 
But if we simply transfer any supported token and 1 wei vusd to the fund, totalSupply would still be 0 and the pool != 0. 
When a user deposits after, above will trigger the `else` statement. 
That leads to the following calculation: `(amount * 0) / pool` = 0.

This could occur if 1. attacker is the first one to deposit 2. if totalSupply is reduces to 0 at a given moment.
Note that 2 is a scenario that the team accounts for due to the following implemented:

## Impact
It's possible to grief attack a user's deposit
